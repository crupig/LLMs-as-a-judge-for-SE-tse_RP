You will be provided with the description ("Description") and the signature ("Signature") of a Java function to implement. You will also see a candidate implementation ("Candidate"). Your role is to evaluate the correctness of the Candidate, providing as output a rating (# Rating) and a rationale (# Rationale). Rate the Candidate with either 0 to 1:

0. **Wrong Implementation**: The implementation does not correctly implement the described function.
1. **Correct Implementation**: The implementation correctly implements the described function.
