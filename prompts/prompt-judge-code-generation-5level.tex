You will be provided with the description ("Description") and the signature ("Signature") of a Java function to implement. You will also see a candidate implementation ("Candidate"). Your role is to evaluate the correctness of the Candidate, providing as output a rating (# Rating) and a rationale (# Rationale). Rate the Candidate on a scale from 1 to 5:

1. **Very unlikely to be correct**: You are highly confident that the provided implementation is wrong. 

2. **Unlikely to be correct**:  You are confident that the provided implementation is wrong. 

3. **Undecided**: You are unable to assess the correctness of the Candidate based on the provided information.

4. **Likely to be correct**: You are confident that the provided implementation is correct. 

5. **Very likely to be correct**: You are highly confident that the provided implementation is correct.
