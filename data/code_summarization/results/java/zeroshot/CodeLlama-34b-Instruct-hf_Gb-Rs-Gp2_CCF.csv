* Content adequacy: 5/5
The comment accurately summarizes the functionality of the `substringMatch` method, which is to check if a substring is contained within a larger string. The comment also includes information about the parameters and return value of the method, which is helpful for users who want to understand how to use the method.

* Conciseness: 4/5
The comment is generally concise and to the point, but there is one area where it could be more concise. The comment mentions that the method returns `true` if the substring is contained within the larger string, but it does not mention what happens if the substring is not contained within the larger string. This information is implied by the method's name and the fact that it returns a boolean value, but it would be more explicit to state it explicitly.

* Fluency & Understandability: 5/5

This method takes a String array as input and returns a new String array with the same length, where each element in the new array is a trimmed version of the corresponding element in the original array. If an element in the original array is null, the corresponding element in the new array will also be null. If the input array is null or empty, an empty array will be returned.

# Comment
This method matches the given CharSequence uri against the regular expression pattern
stored in the regexPattern field. If the pattern is null, it returns an empty string match
result if the uri is empty, and null otherwise. If the pattern is not null, it returns null
if the uri does not match the pattern. If the uri matches the pattern, it returns a
GroupIndexMatchResult if the groupIndexes field is not empty, and the Matcher object
otherwise.

Parameters:

* uri: The CharSequence to match against the regular expression pattern.

Returns:

* A MatchResult object representing the match result, or null if the uri does not match
the pattern or if the pattern is null and the uri is not empty.
#","# Evaluation Criteria

* Content adequacy: 4/5
The comment provides a clear summary of the functionality implemented in the function. It mentions the regular expression pattern stored in the regexPattern field, the behavior when the pattern is null or the uri is empty, and the type of MatchResult object returned in different scenarios. However, it could be more detailed about the specifics of the regular expression pattern and the GroupIndexMatchResult object.

* Conciseness: 4/5
The comment is concise and to the point, providing only the necessary information to understand the functionality of the function. However, it could be even more concise by removing unnecessary words and phrases.

* Fluency & Understandability: 5/5
The comment is written in clear and concise language, making it easy to read and understand. The use of simple sentences and active voice helps to convey the information effectively.

# Docstring:

This method checks whether the given `DataTable` is compatible with the current `HeatMap` instance.

The method first sorts the keys of the `DataTable` using the `KeyComparator` class, which is a custom comparator that sorts keys based on their natural order. The sorted keys are then stored in a `List<String>` called `sortedKeys`.

Next, the method creates a new `long[]` array called `existedBuckets` with the same length as the number of sorted keys.

The method then iterates over the sorted keys and checks whether each key is equal to the `Bucket.INFINITE_NEGATIVE` constant. If it is, the method sets the corresponding element in the `existedBuckets` array to `Long.MIN_VALUE`.

Otherwise, the method checks whether the key contains a colon character (':'). If it does, the method extracts the substring after the last colon character using the `StringUtils.substringAfterLast` method and parses it as a `long` value using the `Long.parseLong` method. The resulting `long` value is then stored in the corresponding element of the `existedBuckets` array.

Finally, the method checks whether the `buckets` array is equal to the `existedBuckets` array using the `Arrays.equals` method. If they are equal, the method returns `true`, otherwise it returns `false`.

Next, the method creates a new `long[]` array called `existedBuckets` with the same length as the number of sorted keys.

The method then iterates over the sorted keys and checks whether each key is equal to the `Bucket.INFINITE_NEGATIVE` constant. If it is, the method sets the corresponding element in the `existedBuckets` array to `Long.MIN_VALUE`.

Otherwise, the method checks whether the key contains a colon character (':'). If it does, the method extracts the substring after the last colon character using the `StringUtils.substringAfterLast` method and parses it as a `long` value using the `Long.parseLong` method. The resulting `long` value is then stored in the corresponding element of the `existedBuckets` array.

Finally, the method checks whether the `buckets` array is equal to the `existedBuckets` array using the `Arrays.equals` method. If they are equal, the method returns `true`, otherwise it returns `false`.

public static String applyRelativePath(String path, String relativePath)

Applies a relative path to a given path, returning the resulting path.

Parameters:

* path: The path to apply the relative path to.
* relativePath: The relative path to apply.

Returns:

* The resulting path, which is the combination of the given path and the relative path.

Throws:

* IllegalArgumentException: If the given path or relative path is null or empty.

Example:

String result = applyRelativePath(""C:\\my\\folder"", ""subfolder"");
// result is ""C:\\my\\folder\\subfolder""
#","# Evaluation Criteria

* Content adequacy: 4/5
The comment summarizes the functionality of the method well, but it could be more detailed. For example, it does not mention what happens if the relative path is absolute or if it contains "".."" to move up the directory tree.

* Conciseness: 4/5
The comment is concise and to the point, but it could be even shorter. For example, the ""Returns"" section could be omitted since it is implied by the method signature.

* Fluency & Understandability: 5/5
The comment is easy to read and understand, and it uses simple language that is easy to follow. The only improvement would be to use more descriptive variable names in the example.

# Comment
This method reads a raw varint64 from the input stream. It returns the decoded value as a long.

The method uses a loop to read bytes from the input stream, starting with the least significant byte. Each byte is masked with 0x7F to remove the continuation bit, and the result is shifted left by 7 bits. The loop continues until the continuation bit is not set, at which point the method returns the decoded value.

If the loop completes without finding a non-continuation byte, the method throws a ProtobufException.malformedVarint() exception.

# Comment
Adds a line number to the current line number or to the list of other line numbers, depending on the current state of the object.

If the current line number is 0, the given line number is set as the current line number. Otherwise, the given line number is added to the list of other line numbers. If the list of other line numbers is null, it is initialized with a capacity of LINE_NUMBERS_CAPACITY_INCREMENT. If the list is full, it is resized to accommodate the new line number.

Parameters:

* lineNumber (int): The line number to add.

Returns:

* void
