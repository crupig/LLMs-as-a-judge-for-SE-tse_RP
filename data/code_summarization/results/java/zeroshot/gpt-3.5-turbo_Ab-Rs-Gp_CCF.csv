Decodes a single hexadecimal nibble (4 bits) from a character.

The method takes a single character as input, and returns the decoded hexadecimal nibble as a character. The input character must be a valid hexadecimal digit (0-9, a-f, or A-F). If the input character is not a valid hexadecimal digit, the method returns `Character.MAX_VALUE`.

The method first checks if the input character is a digit (0-9), and if so, returns the corresponding decimal value (0-9).

# Docstring for startsWith method

This method checks if the given string starts with the given prefix. It takes three parameters:

* `str`: the string to check
* `prefix`: the prefix to check for
* `ignoreCase`: a boolean indicating whether the check should be case-insensitive

The method returns `true` if the string starts with the prefix, and `false` otherwise. If either `str` or `prefix` is `null`, the method returns `false`.

The method uses the `regionMatches` method to perform the check, which allows for case-insensitive matching if the `ignoreCase` parameter is `true`.

Example usage:

```
String str = ""Hello, world!"";
String prefix = ""Hello"";
boolean startsWithPrefix = startsWith(str, prefix, true);
System.out.println(startsWithPrefix); // Output: true
```
```
String str = ""Hello, world!"";
String prefix = ""goodbye"";
boolean startsWithPrefix = startsWith(str, prefix, false);
System.out.println(startsWithPrefix); // Output: false
```
```
String str = null;
String prefix = ""Hello"";
boolean startsWithPrefix = startsWith(str, prefix, true);
System.out.println(startsWithPrefix); // Output: false
```
```
String str = ""Hello, world!"";

## Rationale: The comment provides a good summary of the functionality implemented in the function. It explains that the function computes the global separator list for each edge in the graph by finding minimal separators in the neighborhood of each edge and concatenating these lists. It also mentions the possibility of duplicates in the result. However, it could be improved by specifying the types used (e.g., V, E) and providing more details on the reformatting process.

# Docstring:

The `split` method takes two string arguments, `toSplit` and `delimiter`, and returns an array of two strings. The first string in the array is the substring of `toSplit` that comes before the first occurrence of `delimiter`, and the second string is the substring that comes after the first occurrence of `delimiter`. If `toSplit` does not contain `delimiter`, or if either argument is null or empty, the method returns null.

The method first checks if both arguments have a length greater than 0. If not, it returns null. Then, it finds the index of the first occurrence of `delimiter` in `toSplit`. If `delimiter` is not found, the method returns null. Otherwise, it creates two substrings: one that starts at the beginning of `toSplit` and ends at the index of `delimiter`, and another that starts at the index of `delimiter` plus the length of `delimiter` and ends at the end of `toSplit`. The method then returns an array containing these two substrings.

Example usage:
```
String[] parts = split(""hello,world"", "","");
// parts[0] == ""hello""
// parts[1] == ""world""
```
```
String[] parts = split(""hello"", "","");
// parts == null

# Copy an array and grow it by 1 element

This method takes an array and a new array component type as input, and returns a new array with the same elements as the input array, but with an additional element at the end. The new element is initialized to the default value for the new array component type.

The method first checks if the input array is null, and if so, it returns a new array with a single element of the specified type. If the input array is not null, it creates a new array with one more element than the input array, and copies the elements of the input array to the new array. The new element is initialized to the default value for the new array component type.

The method uses the `Array.getLength()` method to get the length of the input array, and the `Array.newInstance()` method to create a new array with the same component type as the input array. The `System.arraycopy()` method is used to copy the elements of the input array to the new array.

The method returns the new array with the added element.
