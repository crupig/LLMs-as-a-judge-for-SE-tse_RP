This method returns the intersection of two sets. The intersection is defined as the set of elements that are common to both sets. The method takes two sets as input and returns a new set containing the intersection of the two sets. The method uses the Java 8 Stream API to perform the intersection operation.

The method first checks the size of the two sets and swaps them if necessary so that the smaller set is used for the intersection operation. This is done to improve performance by reducing the number of elements that need to be processed.

The method then uses the `stream()` method to create a stream of elements from the smaller set, and the `filter()` method to filter out any elements that are not present in the larger set. Finally, the `collect()` method is used to collect the remaining elements into a new set, which is returned as the result of the method.

Returns the edge that connects the current node to the next node in the graph.

The method first retrieves the edge that is embedded in the previous node (prev.embedded.getFirst()). It then retrieves the target node (toExistingNode(current)) and the source node (toExistingNode(prev)). If the opposite node of the edge is the target node, the method returns the edge.

Returns:

* Filter.NEUTRAL: If the event is neutral or if the string match is not found.
* Filter.ACCEPT: If the event should be accepted.
* Filter.DENY: If the event should be denied.

This method first checks if the event's rendered message is null or if the string to match is null. If either of these conditions is true, the method returns Filter.NEUTRAL.

Next, the method checks if the event's rendered message contains the string to match. If the string is found, the method returns Filter.ACCEPT if the acceptOnMatch flag is true, or Filter.DENY if the flag is false.

If the string is not found, the method returns Filter.NEUTRAL.

This method checks if a given set of vertices in a graph form a clique, which is a subgraph in which every vertex is connected to every other vertex. The method takes two parameters: a graph and a set of vertices. It returns true if the vertices form a clique, and false otherwise.

The method works by iterating over the vertices in the set and checking if there is an edge between each pair of vertices. If there is no edge between two vertices, the method returns false. If the method completes the iteration without finding any missing edges, it returns true.

The method is static, meaning that it can be called without creating an instance of the class.

# Comment
This method checks if a given set of vertices in a graph form a clique, which is a subgraph in which every vertex is connected to every other vertex. The method takes two parameters: a graph and a set of vertices. It returns true if the vertices form a clique, and false otherwise.

The method works by iterating over the vertices in the set and checking if there is an edge between each pair of vertices. If there is no edge between two vertices, the method returns false. If the method completes the iteration without finding any missing edges, it returns true.

The method is static, meaning that it can be called without creating an instance of the class. It is also generic, meaning that it can be used with any type of graph and set of vertices.

# Docstring for toPrimitive(Character[] array)

Converts a `Character[]` array to a `char[]` array.

Parameters:

* `array`: The `Character[]` array to convert.

Returns:

* The resulting `char[]` array.

Throws:

* `NullPointerException`: If `array` is `null`.

Example:

```
Character[] characters = new Character[] { 'a', 'b', 'c' };
char[] chars = ArrayUtils.toPrimitive(characters);
```
```

This method is a convenience method for converting a `Character[]` array to a `char[]` array. It is equivalent to the following code:

```
char[] chars = new char[array.length];
for (int i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {
  chars[i] = array[i].charValue();
}
```

However, this method is more efficient and easier to read.

Note that this method returns `null` if the input array is `null`, and an empty `char[]` array if the input array is empty.","# Docstring for toPrimitive(Character[] array)

# Comment
This method encodes template names in a string by replacing any occurrences of '{' and '}' with '%7B' and '%7D', respectively. The method takes a single string argument and returns the encoded string.

The method first finds the index of the first '{' character in the string using the `indexOf` method. If the index is not -1 (i.e., the character is found), the method replaces the '{' character with '%7B' using the `replace` method.

The method then finds the index of the first '}' character in the string using the `indexOf` method. If the index is not -1 (i.e., the character is found), the method replaces the '}' character with '%7D' using the `replace` method.

Finally, the method returns the encoded string.

Note: The '%7B' and '%7D' are the URL-encoded versions of '{' and '}', respectively.

# Docstring for readTag() method

This method reads a tag from the input stream and returns it as an integer. If the buffer has no remaining bytes, the method returns 0 and sets the lastTag field to 0. If the tag is invalid, the method throws a ProtobufException. If the tag is valid, the method sets the lastTag field to the tag value and returns it.

The method uses the readRawVarint32() method to read the raw varint value from the input stream. It then checks if the tag is valid by checking if the most significant 3 bits are set to 0. If the tag is invalid, the method throws an exception.

The method is declared to throw an IOException if an I/O error occurs while reading from the input stream.

This method looks up a converter for the given class in the registry.

Parameters:

* clazz: The class for which a converter is needed.

Returns:

* A converter for the given class, or null if no converter is found.

Throws:

* NullPointerException if clazz is null.

Notes:

* The method first checks if a converter is already registered for the given class. If a converter is found, it is returned.
* If no converter is found, the method iterates over the registered converters and checks if any of them can convert the given class. If a converter is found, it is returned.
* If no converter is found, null is returned.

Otherwise, a new AtmosphereRequest is created by copying the attributes of the given request into a new Builder object, and then building the AtmosphereRequest from the Builder.

The method first checks if the given request is an instance of AtmosphereRequestImpl, and if so, it simply casts the request to AtmosphereRequestImpl and returns it. Otherwise, it creates a new Builder object and copies the attributes of the given request into the Builder's localAttributes map. The method then builds the AtmosphereRequest from the Builder and returns it.

The method is static, so it can be called without creating an instance of the class.

Parameters:

# Comment
This method is used to wrap an existing `HttpServletRequest` object in an `AtmosphereRequest` object. It does this by creating a new `AtmosphereRequestImpl` object and copying the attributes from the original request to the new object.

The method first checks if the original request is already an `AtmosphereRequestImpl` object, and if so, it simply returns the original request. Otherwise, it creates a new `Builder` object and iterates over the attributes of the original request using the `getAttributeNames()` method. For each attribute, it adds a new entry to the `localAttributes` map of the `Builder` object, using the attribute name as the key and the attribute value as the value.

Finally, the method returns the new `AtmosphereRequestImpl` object, which is built using the `request()` method of the `Builder` object and the original `HttpServletRequest` object.

This method is useful for wrapping an existing `HttpServletRequest` object in an `AtmosphereRequest` object, which can then be used to access the attributes of the original request in a more convenient way.
