* Content adequacy:
	5: The information in the summary is correct and comprehensive. There is information which cannot be inferred by reading the signature.
	4: The information in the summary is correct, but may lack the documentation of some corner cases (e.g., exceptions). There is information which cannot be inferred by reading the signature.
	3: The information in the summary is correct, but it mostly describes the method's signature.
	2: The information in the summary is partially correct (i.e., features wrong information) and/or lacks the description of large and relevant parts of the method (e.g., when documenting the return value, only a subset of the possible values is reported).
	1: The information in the summary is completely out of scope.

* Conciseness:
	5: The summary does not contain unneeded and trivial explanations. All text is instrumental to the code understanding.
	4: The summary features some extra explanations which may be unnecessary for most of users (e.g., defining trivial concepts such as what the intersection of two sets is).
	3: The summary features unneeded repetitions (i.e., the same concept is explained multiple times).
	2: The summary mostly features verbose explanations of information which is clearly visible in the code, such as explaining the signature. Repetitions are also present.
	1: The summary mostly features verbose explanations of information which is clearly visible in the code, such as explaining the types of parameters, the return type, etc. Repetitions are present as well as sentences explaining concepts unrelated to the code documentation (e.g., what a private method is).

* Fluency & Understandability:
	5: The summary is very easy to read and understand and does not require any specific domain knowledge to be understood.
	4: The summary is easy to read and understand but may require some specific domain knowledge to be understood.
	3: The summary is easy to read and understand for developers having expertise on that system.

# Comment
Parse command line arguments into a structured dictionary.

This function takes an unspecified number of arguments, typically command line arguments,
processes them using a nested parser structure, and consolidates them into a dictionary
with keys for global settings and individual subparser results.

Parameters:
unparsed_arguments (str): A variable-length argument tuple representing the arguments
passed to the command line.

Raises:
ValueError: If incompatible or outdated options are specified.

Returns:
dict: A dictionary containing the structured and parsed arguments. Global options are
stored under the 'global' key, while other keys correspond to sub-command names,
each containing respective parsed arguments.

	4: The information in the summary is correct, but may lack the documentation of some corner cases (e.g., exceptions). There is information which cannot be inferred by reading the signature.
	3: The information in the summary is correct, but it mostly describes the method's signature.
	2: The information in the summary is partially correct (i.e., features wrong information) and/or lacks the description of large and relevant parts of the method (e.g., when documenting the return value, only a subset of the possible values is reported).
	1: The information in the summary is completely out of scope.

* Conciseness:
	5: The summary does not contain unneeded and trivial explanations. All text is instrumental to the code understanding.
	4: The summary features some extra explanations which may be unnecessary for most of users (e.g., defining trivial concepts such as what the intersection of two sets is).
	3: The summary features unneeded repetitions (i.e., the same concept is explained multiple times).
	2: The summary mostly features verbose explanations of information which is clearly visible in the code, such as explaining the signature. Repetitions are also present.
	1: The summary mostly features verbose explanations of information which is clearly visible in the code, such as explaining the types of parameters, the return type, etc. Repetitions are present as well as sentences explaining concepts unrelated to the code documentation (e.g., what a private method is).

from the node with the lower priority,
to the node with the higher priority,
unless both the nodes of the 2 conflicting pairs are not dict nor list.

If so, this function just adds the node with the higher priority to the node with
the lower priority.

Lastly, if a conflict occurs
between 2 nodes where one node is the implicit base and another node is not the implicit base,
it always chooses the node that is not the implicit base,
regardless of their types.

Therefore, this function has 2 base assumptions:

1. The result should always be a dictionary.
2. It assumes that if a conflict occurs between 2 nodes that are not dictionaries,
a list should be the result,
where the first element is the node with the lower priority.

This function is designed to be called twice.
For the first time,
the base node is the node with the lower priority.
For the second time,
the base node is the node with the higher priority.","You will be provided with a Python function (""Function"") and a textual summary of it (""Comment"").

# Comment
Generates a list of dictionaries and an implicit base.

Applies a priority-based approach, where the value of (a_key, a_value) has lower priority
than (b_key, b_value) when they are in conflict.

Detects when values in (a_key, a_value) and (b_key, b_value) are in conflict and of
different types (dict, list, scalar).

Assumes that whenever they are of the same type,
the result should be to merge them.

To handle conflicts between 2 dictionaries (a_key, a_value) and (b_key, b_value),
assumes that they should be merged.
To handle conflicts between a list and a scalar value
(a_key, a_value) and (b_key, b_value),
assumes that the result should be the list with the scalar as its first element.

Whenever 2 nodes are in conflict,
this function iterates through the 2 nodes with the lower priority and,
for each such node,
it detects if any node with the same key and value exists in the other node.

If so, this function (recursively) adds the nodes that share the same key and value,
from the node with the lower priority,
to the node with the higher priority,
unless both the nodes of the 2 conflicting pairs are not dict nor list.

If so, this function just adds the node with the higher priority to the node with
the lower priority.

Lastly, if a conflict occurs
between 2 nodes where one node is the implicit base and another node is not the implicit base,
it always chooses the node that is not the implicit base,
regardless of their types.

Therefore, this function has 2 base assumptions:

1. The result should always be a dictionary.
2. It assumes that if a conflict occurs between 2 nodes that are not dictionaries,

# Comment
Recursively merges nodes based on certain rules, handling conflicts and duplications.

This function is tailored for processing YAML nodes leveraging `ruamel.yaml` library structures
such as MappingNode and SequenceNode. It performs a deep merge where nodes with the same tag and value
are considered for merging but not directly replaced.

Parameters:
nodes (list of tuple): A list of tuples, where each tuple consists of a (key, value) pair representing
YAML nodes to be merged.

Returns:
list: A list of nodes after applying the deep merge logic, with adjustments for conflicting or duplicated nodes.

The merge operation:
- Identifies nodes with matching tags and values.
- Replaces conflicting nodes marked by the DELETED_NODE.
- Merges nodes if they are MappingNodes or SequenceNodes, recursively merging their contents.

Notes:
- The function assumes `nodes` are well-formed according to `ruamel.yaml` node structure.
- `DELETED_NODE` is a constant marker used to signify nodes that should be removed in the merge process.

# Evaluation Criteria & Rules
* Content adequacy:
	5: The information in the summary is correct and comprehensive. There is information which cannot be inferred by reading the signature.
	4: The information in the summary is correct, but may lack the documentation of some corner cases (e.g., exceptions). There is information which cannot be inferred by reading the signature.
	3: The information in the summary is correct, but it mostly describes the method's signature.
	2: The information in the summary is partially correct (i.e., features wrong information) and/or lacks the description of large and relevant parts of the method (e.g., when documenting the return value, only a subset of the possible values is reported).
	1: The information in the summary is completely out of scope.

* Conciseness:
	5: The summary does not contain unneeded and trivial explanations. All text is instrumental to the code understanding.
	4: The summary features some extra explanations which may be unnecessary for most of users (e.g., defining trivial concepts such as what the intersection of two sets is).
	3: The summary features unneeded repetitions (i.e., the same concept is explained multiple times).
	2: The summary mostly features verbose explanations of information which is clearly visible in the code, such as explaining the signature. Repetitions are also present.
	1: The summary mostly features verbose explanations of information which is clearly visible in the code, such as explaining the types of parameters, the return type, etc. Repetitions are present as well as sentences explaining concepts unrelated to the code documentation (e.g., what a private method is).

* Fluency & Understandability:
	5: The summary is very easy to read and understand and does not require any specific domain knowledge to be understood.
	4: The summary is easy to read and understand but may require some specific domain knowledge to be understood.
	3: The summary is easy to read and understand for developers having expertise on that system.
	2: The summary is difficult to read and understand, but it is grammatically correct.
	1: The summary is difficult to read and understand, and grammatically incorrect.

# Evaluation Criteria & Rules
* Content adequacy:
	5: The information in the summary is correct and comprehensive. There is information which cannot be inferred by reading the signature.
	4: The information in the summary is correct, but may lack the documentation of some corner cases (e.g., exceptions). There is information which cannot be inferred by reading the signature.
	3: The information in the summary is correct, but it mostly describes the method's signature.
	2: The information in the summary is partially correct (i.e., features wrong information) and/or lacks the description of large and relevant parts of the method (e.g., when documenting the return value, only a subset of the possible values is reported).
	1: The information in the summary is completely out of scope.

* Conciseness:
	5: The summary does not contain unneeded and trivial explanations. All text is instrumental to the code understanding.
	4: The summary features some extra explanations which may be unnecessary for most of users (e.g., defining trivial concepts such as what the intersection of two sets is).
	3: The summary features unneeded repetitions (i.e., the same concept is explained multiple times).
	2: The summary mostly features verbose explanations of information which is clearly visible in the code, such as explaining the signature. Repetitions are also present.
	1: The summary mostly features verbose explanations of information which is clearly visible in the code, such as explaining the types of parameters, the return type, etc. Repetitions are present as well as sentences explaining concepts unrelated to the code documentation (e.g., what a private method is).

* Fluency & Understandability:
	5: The summary is very easy to read and understand and does not require any specific domain knowledge to be understood.
	4: The summary is easy to read and understand but may require some specific domain knowledge to be understood.
	3: The summary is easy to read and understand for developers having expertise on that system.
	2: The summary is difficult to read and understand, but it is grammatically correct.
	1: The summary is difficult to read and understand, and grammatically incorrect.

# Evaluation Criteria & Rules
* Content adequacy:
	5: The information in the summary is correct and comprehensive. There is information which cannot be inferred by reading the signature.
	4: The information in the summary is correct, but may lack the documentation of some corner cases (e.g., exceptions). There is information which cannot be inferred by reading the signature.
	3: The information in the summary is correct, but it mostly describes the method's signature.
	2: The information in the summary is partially correct (i.e., features wrong information) and/or lacks the description of large and relevant parts of the method (e.g., when documenting the return value, only a subset of the possible values is reported).
	1: The information in the summary is completely out of scope.

* Conciseness:
	5: The summary does not contain unneeded and trivial explanations. All text is instrumental to the code understanding.
	4: The summary features some extra explanations which may be unnecessary for most of users (e.g., defining trivial concepts such as what the intersection of two sets is).
	3: The summary features unneeded repetitions (i.e., the same concept is explained multiple times).
	2: The summary mostly features verbose explanations of information which is clearly visible in the code, such as explaining the signature. Repetitions are also present.
	1: The summary mostly features verbose explanations of information which is clearly visible in the code, such as explaining the types of parameters, the return type, etc. Repetitions are present as well as sentences explaining concepts unrelated to the code documentation (e.g., what a private method is).

* Fluency & Understandability:
	5: The summary is very easy to read and understand and does not require any specific domain knowledge to be understood.
	4: The summary is easy to read and understand but may require some specific domain knowledge to be understood.
	3: The summary is easy to read and understand for developers having expertise on that system.
	2: The summary is difficult to read and understand, but it is grammatically correct.
	1: The summary is difficult to read and understand, and grammatically incorrect.

# Comment
The function validates the OCFL Inventory. It first checks if the id, type, digestAlgorithm and contentDirectory attributes are present and correct. Then it checks the format and contents of the manifest and fixity files. It also checks the ids and object types in the version sequences and the head.

The function returns None.

# Evaluation Criteria & Rules
* Content adequacy:
	5: The information in the summary is correct and comprehensive. There is information which cannot be inferred by reading the signature.
	4: The information in the summary is correct, but may lack the documentation of some corner cases (e.g., exceptions). There is information which cannot be inferred by reading the signature.
	3: The information in the summary is correct, but it mostly describes the method's signature.
	2: The information in the summary is partially correct (i.e., features wrong information) and/or lacks the description of large and relevant parts of the method (e.g., when documenting the return value, only a subset of the possible values is reported).
	1: The information in the summary is completely out of scope.

* Conciseness:
	5: The summary does not contain unneeded and trivial explanations. All text is instrumental to the code understanding.
	4: The summary features some extra explanations which may be unnecessary for most of users (e.g., defining trivial concepts such as what the intersection of two sets is).
	3: The summary features unneeded repetitions (i.e., the same concept is explained multiple times).
	2: The summary mostly features verbose explanations of information which is clearly visible in the code, such as explaining the signature. Repetitions are also present.
	1: The summary mostly features verbose explanations of information which is clearly visible in the code, such as explaining the types of parameters, the return type, etc. Repetitions are present as well as sentences explaining concepts unrelated to the code documentation (e.g., what a private method is).

* Fluency & Understandability:
	5: The summary is very easy to read and understand and does not require any specific domain knowledge to be understood.
	4: The summary is easy to read and understand but may require some specific domain knowledge to be understood.
	3: The summary is easy to read and understand for developers having expertise on that system.
	2: The summary is difficult to read and understand, but it is grammatically correct.
	1: The summary is difficult to read and understand, and grammatically incorrect.

# Comment
This method validates the structure and contents of an inventory object according to OCFL specifications. It checks various attributes such as 'id', 'type', 'digestAlgorithm', 'contentDirectory', 'manifest', 'versions', 'head', and 'fixity' for correctness and consistency. Optionally, it extracts the spec version and performs additional validation based on that version. The method raises appropriate errors and warnings if any issues are encountered during the validation process.

# Evaluation Criteria & Rules
* Content adequacy:
	5: The information in the summary is correct and comprehensive. There is information which cannot be inferred by reading the signature.
	4: The information in the summary is correct, but may lack the documentation of some corner cases (e.g., exceptions). There is information which cannot be inferred by reading the signature.
	3: The information in the summary is correct, but it mostly describes the method's signature.
	2: The information in the summary is partially correct (i.e., features wrong information) and/or lacks the description of large and relevant parts of the method (e.g., when documenting the return value, only a subset of the possible values is reported).
	1: The information in the summary is completely out of scope.

* Conciseness:
	5: The summary does not contain unneeded and trivial explanations. All text is instrumental to the code understanding.
	4: The summary features some extra explanations which may be unnecessary for most of users (e.g., defining trivial concepts such as what the intersection of two sets is).
	3: The summary features unneeded repetitions (i.e., the same concept is explained multiple times).
	2: The summary mostly features verbose explanations of information which is clearly visible in the code, such as explaining the signature. Repetitions are also present.
	1: The summary mostly features verbose explanations of information which is clearly visible in the code, such as explaining the types of parameters, the return type, etc. Repetitions are present as well as sentences explaining concepts unrelated to the code documentation (e.g., what a private method is).

* Fluency & Understandability:
	5: The summary is very easy to read and understand and does not require any specific domain knowledge to be understood.
	4: The summary is easy to read and understand but may require some specific domain knowledge to be understood.
	3: The summary is easy to read and understand for developers having expertise on that system.
	2: The summary is difficult to read and understand, but it is grammatically correct.

# Comment
Validates that the current inventory includes an identical version history to the prior inventory.

The version history is inspected (by sorting, not comparing), looking for logical paths that exist in either the prior or the current version. Those logical paths are then checked to see if the prior version is identical to the current version. If they are not identical, an error is raised with a detailed list of the differences. Additionally, if the prior version does not have the same `created`, `message`, or `user` fields as the current version, a warning is generated to the user.

To avoid comparing the entire inventory, only the versions prior to `self.all_versions` are compared. To avoid comparing a version for which the digest algorithm is different, only the versions that have the same `digest_algorithm` as `self.digest_algorithm` are compared.

# Comment
Validates the content of inventory *prior* against an expected logical
state. This test helps us check that the version has effectively been
added to the expected locations. It raises an error if:

- The inventory was created on a different digest algorithm than the one
- The inventory has all_versions defined on its root path (E066a)
- Any logical path was found in one inventory but not the other
- Any logical path had a different set of artifacts defined for one
inventory than the other (E066c)
- The same logical path was not defined on both versions.
- Any logically defined path had one of the defined artifact not existing
in the other (E066a)

Warnings:

- W011 Any unforeseen change in creation, user, message or hash for a
particular version (E066a)

# Comment
Validates that the provided 'prior' object is an acceptable predecessor of the current object according
to a set of rules concerning version containment, digest algorithms, directory contents, and metadata.

This method checks that all versions from 'prior' exist in the current object, compares state for matching
digest algorithms, and validates logical path maps and metadata consistency across versions.

Parameters:
prior (object): An object assumed to represent a prior state. It should have attributes 'all_versions',
'digest_algorithm', 'inventory', and methods for error and warning handling.

Raises:
Throws an error if:
- The prior versions are not completely contained within the current versions (error 'E066a').
- There are discrepancies in the logical path contents that are not shared mutually between 'prior' and
'self' for any version (error 'E066b').
- Subset comparisons of logical paths fail (error 'E066c').

Warns if metadata attributes ('created', 'message', 'user') are different between versions (warning 'W011').

The method mainly compares the states based on logical paths, metadata, and digest algorithms and uses internal
methods like 'compare_states_for_version' and 'error'/'warning' for handling discrepancies.

# Comment
Validates the fixity block against the specifications and manifest files.

This method ensures that the provided `fixity` dictionary complies with the structure and digest patterns expected per `digest_algorithm`.
It checks against multiple validation rules and raises errors if specific conditions are not met, based on the provided spec version.

Parameters:
- fixity (dict): A dictionary mapping from digest algorithms to another dictionary, which in turn maps digests to lists of file paths.
- manifest_files (list): A list of file paths that should be present in the manifest files against which the fixity will be checked.

Raises:
- Various custom error codes through the `self.error()` method based on different conditions:
- E056a/E111 for non-dict fixity input based on spec version.
- E056b for unrecognized digest algorithms.
- E057a for non-dict entries under a digest algorithm.
- E057b for digest entries not matching expected regex patterns.
- E057c for files listed under digest that are not in a list format.
- E057d for any file path under a digest entry not found in `manifest_files`.
- E097 for duplicate normalized digests detected in the same algorithm block.

The method supports both lax and strict handling of digests, which is determined by the `self.lax_digests` attribute, allowing some flexibility based on invalid or unknown digest patterns.

The information in the summary is correct, but it mostly describes the method's signature.
The summary features some extra explanations which may be unnecessary for most of users (e.g., defining trivial concepts such as what the intersection of two sets is).
The summary is very easy to read and understand and does not require any specific domain knowledge to be understood.

the function returns an error message. It checks if the path or parent path
exists and whether the path is a directory or file. Additionally, it identifies
whether the filesystem root at the path has certain characteristics based on
predefined '0=' declaration files.

str: A description of the path's type, such as 'file', 'directory', 'root',
'object', or an error message if the path or its parent cannot be opened,
does not exist, or features unrecognized '0=' declaration files.

Raises:
OpenerError: If the path or its parent directory cannot be opened as a filesystem.
CreateFailed: If the filesystem at the path cannot be created or accessed.
ResourceNotFound: If the specified path does not exist in the filesystem.

# Comment
Function `find_path_type(path: str)` determines the type of resource located at path.

- `path` - Path to a filesystem or resource on a filesystem. May either refer to the root of the filesystem, an object, or a file that serves as the manifest for this code (e.g. the 0= declaration file.)

Returns a `str` representing the type of resource located at path.

Error cases include:

- If path can't be opened. A `fuse.errors.OpenerError` or `fs.errors.CreateFailed` exception is raised.

- If path is a file that does not have the expected properties as a manifest for this code. Return value is `file` if the file exists but is not a manifest for this code, `root` if path is the root of a filesystem that does not contain a valid manifest for this code, and ""unrecognized 0= declaration file or files (first is %s)"" if path is not the root of a filesystem and the filesystem doesn't contain a valid manifest for this code.

- If path is a directory that has the expected properties as a manifest for this code. Return value is `root` or `object`, depending on whether path is the root of a filesystem that contains a valid manifest for this code.

# Comment
This method validates the inventories of different versions by checking for the existence of inventory files, comparing inventory files in the last version with the root inventory file, validating inventory digests, and ensuring consistency in manifest and fixity information across versions. It also handles error logging for various scenarios and maintains a record of prior manifest and fixity digests.

Your role is to evaluate the Comment across three criteria on a scale from 1 to 5, providing as output for each of them a rating (# Rating) as described in the following, and no other text.

# Evaluation Criteria & Rules
* Content adequacy:
	5: The information in the summary is correct and comprehensive. There is information which cannot be inferred by reading the signature.
	4: The information in the summary is correct, but may lack the documentation of some corner cases (e.g., exceptions). There is information which cannot be inferred by reading the signature.
	3: The information in the summary is correct, but it mostly describes the method's signature.
	2: The information in the summary is partially correct (i.e., features wrong information) and/or lacks the description of large and relevant parts of the method (e.g., when documenting the return value, only a subset of the possible values is reported).
	1: The information in the summary is completely out of scope.

* Conciseness:
	5: The summary does not contain unneeded and trivial explanations. All text is instrumental to the code understanding.
	4: The summary features some extra explanations which may be unnecessary for most of users (e.g., defining trivial concepts such as what the intersection of two sets is).
	3: The summary features unneeded repetitions (i.e., the same concept is explained multiple times).
	2: The summary mostly features verbose explanations of information which is clearly visible in the code, such as explaining the signature. Repetitions are also present.
	1: The summary mostly features verbose explanations of information which is clearly visible in the code, such as explaining the types of parameters, the return type, etc. Repetitions are present as well as sentences explaining concepts unrelated to the code documentation (e.g., what a private method is).

* Fluency & Understandability:
	5: The summary is very easy to read and understand and does not require any specific domain knowledge to be understood.
	4: The summary is easy to read and understand but may require some specific domain knowledge to be understood.
	3: The summary is easy to read and understand for developers having expertise on that system.
	2: The summary is difficult to read and understand, but it is grammatically correct.

# Comment
Generates a list of the inventory digests for each file.

Note:

At the last version, inventory files have not been linked, so the root inventory.json does not
have the digest attribute. The root inventory.json is validated, and its digest is checked against
the manifest and fixity digests of its predecessor version directories.
Otherwise, each inventory.json is validated, and its digest is checked against the manifest and fixity
digests of its predecessor version directories.

Note:

The spec_version of the version directories is validated to be increasing. If they are not, the error
E103 is logged, and the program terminates.

The goal of the Comment is to document the functionality implemented in the Function. Your role is to evaluate the Comment across three criteria on a scale from 1 to 5, providing as output for each of them a rating (# Rating) as described in the following, and no other text.

# Evaluation Criteria & Rules
* Content adequacy:
	5: The information in the summary is correct and comprehensive. There is information which cannot be inferred by reading the signature.
	4: The information in the summary is correct, but may lack the documentation of some corner cases (e.g., exceptions). There is information which cannot be inferred by reading the signature.
	3: The information in the summary is correct, but it mostly describes the method's signature.
	2: The information in the summary is partially correct (i.e., features wrong information) and/or lacks the description of large and relevant parts of the method (e.g., when documenting the return value, only a subset of the possible values is reported).
	1: The information in the summary is completely out of scope.

* Conciseness:
	5: The summary does not contain unneeded and trivial explanations. All text is instrumental to the code understanding.
	4: The summary features some extra explanations which may be unnecessary for most of users (e.g., defining trivial concepts such as what the intersection of two sets is).
	3: The summary features unneeded repetitions (i.e., the same concept is explained multiple times).
	2: The summary mostly features verbose explanations of information which is clearly visible in the code, such as explaining the signature. Repetitions are also present.
	1: The summary mostly features verbose explanations of information which is clearly visible in the code, such as explaining the types of parameters, the return type, etc. Repetitions are present as well as sentences explaining concepts unrelated to the code documentation (e.g., what a private method is).

* Fluency & Understandability:
	5: The summary is very easy to read and understand and does not require any specific domain knowledge to be understood.
	4: The summary is easy to read and understand but may require some specific domain knowledge to be understood.
	3: The summary is easy to read and understand for developers having expertise on that system.
	2: The summary is difficult to read and understand, but it is grammatically correct.
	1: The summary is difficult to read and understand, and grammatically incorrect.

# Comment
Each version SHOULD have an inventory up to that point.

Also keep a record of any content digests different from those in the root inventory
so that we can also check them when validating the content.

version_dirs is an array of version directory names and is assumed to be in
version sequence (1, 2, 3...).

# Comment
Validates the inventories across different version directories and accumulates the prior manifest and fixity digests.

Processes each version directory to validate the associated inventory JSON file against expected specifications and
builds historical tracking of file digest across versions. It logs warnings and errors for missing inventory files,
mismatches between the root and current inventory, discrepancies in file ID across different versions, and version specification downgrading.

Parameters:
version_dirs (list of str): List of directory paths which store version-specific inventory files.

Returns:
tuple: Returns two dictionaries:
- first dictionary maps file paths to their respective digest algorithms and associated digests across versions found in manifest sections.
- second dictionary maps file paths to their respective digest algorithms and associated digests across versions found in fixity sections.

This method relies heavily on logging for error and warning output and mutates state related to inventory validation.

	4: The information in the summary is correct, but may lack the documentation of some corner cases (e.g., exceptions). There is information which cannot be inferred by reading the signature.
	3: The information in the summary is correct, but it mostly describes the method's signature.
	2: The information in the summary is partially correct (i.e., features wrong information) and/or lacks the description of large and relevant parts of the method (e.g., when documenting the return value, only a subset of the possible values is reported).
	1: The information in the summary is completely out of scope.

* Conciseness:
	5: The summary does not contain unneeded and trivial explanations. All text is instrumental to the code understanding.
	4: The summary features some extra explanations which may be unnecessary for most of users (e.g., defining trivial concepts such as what the intersection of two sets is).

# Annotations
This is an example of a comment for a Python function. The comment is correct, but it is too verbose and does not provide much additional information beyond the function signature.

The comment could be improved by removing the repetition of the function name, and by providing a brief explanation of what the disposition parameter is.

The function name is mentioned twice, but the comment does not provide any information beyond what can be inferred from the signature.

The function is not well-documented",5,3,4

# Evaluation Criteria & Rules
* Content adequacy:
	5: The information in the summary is correct and comprehensive. There is information which cannot be inferred by reading the signature.
	4: The information in the summary is correct, but may lack the documentation of some corner cases (e.g., exceptions). There is information which cannot be inferred by reading the signature.
	3: The information in the summary is correct, but it mostly describes the method's signature.
	2: The information in the summary is partially correct (i.e., features wrong information) and/or lacks the description of large and relevant parts of the method (e.g., when documenting the return value, only a subset of the possible values is reported).
	1: The information in the summary is completely out of scope.

* Conciseness:
	5: The summary does not contain unneeded and trivial explanations. All text is instrumental to the code understanding.
	4: The summary features some extra explanations which may be unnecessary for most of users (e.g., defining trivial concepts such as what the intersection of two sets is).
	3: The summary features unneeded repetitions (i.e., the same concept is explained multiple times).
	2: The summary mostly features verbose explanations of information which is clearly visible in the code, such as explaining the signature. Repetitions are also present.
	1: The summary mostly features verbose explanations of information which is clearly visible in the code, such as explaining the types of parameters, the return type, etc. Repetitions are present as well as sentences explaining concepts unrelated to the code documentation (e.g., what a private method is).

* Fluency & Understandability:
	5: The summary is very easy to read and understand and does not require any specific domain knowledge to be understood.
	4: The summary is easy to read and understand but may require some specific domain knowledge to be understood.
	3: The summary is easy to read and understand for developers having expertise on that system.
	2: The summary is difficult to read and understand, but it is grammatically correct.

# Comment
Groups and organizes files associated with XML files, categorizing them into packages.

This method takes a list of XML files and other related files and groups the related
files under each XML file based on a specific prefix extracted from the XML filename.
Each group is represented as a 'Package' object, stored inside the dictionary 'docs'.

Args:
source (str): The source directory or identifier from where the files are loaded.
xmls (list[str]): List of paths to XML files that guide the organization of related files.
files (list[str]): List of paths to files that are to be grouped according to their association
with an XML file.

Returns:
dict: A dictionary where keys are prefixes derived from XML filenames, and values are 'Package'
objects containing associated assets or renditions organized under each XML file.

Note:
This function modifies the `files` list in-place by removing files that have been grouped.

Side effects:
- Modifies the input list `files`.
- Dynamically accesses and creates 'Package' objects and assigns xml and files to them.

Example:
Given a source 'local_data', xmls ['data/info1.xml', 'data/info2.xml'], and files
['data/info1_imageA.tif', 'data/info2_docB.pdf'], this function would organize files into
packages based on the base names 'info1' and 'info2', treating 'info1_imageA.tif' and
'info2_docB.pdf' as assets for the respective XML files.

# Comment
Evaluates a file based on its name and extension relative to a specified prefix and determines its properties.

Args:
prefix (str): The prefix used to identify and process specific files.
file_path (str): The path to the file that needs to be evaluated.

Returns:
dict: A dictionary containing different properties of the file such as component ID, file path,
and potentially component name and file type, depending on the evaluation criteria.

Description:
This function checks if the given file matches a specified prefix and ignores it if not. Also, files with `.xml`
extension are immediately returned without further processing. For files with a `.pdf` extension, it checks
if the file name exactly matches the prefix or has a specific suffix indicating language, and assigns component
IDs accordingly. For other file types, it returns a dictionary with the file's basename, name without extension,
file type, and file path.

# Evaluation Criteria & Rules
* Content adequacy:
	5: The information in the summary is correct and comprehensive. There is information which cannot be inferred by reading the signature.
	4: The information in the summary is correct, but may lack the documentation of some corner cases (e.g., exceptions). There is information which cannot be inferred by reading the signature.
	3: The information in the summary is correct, but it mostly describes the method's signature.
	2: The information in the summary is partially correct (i.e., features wrong information) and/or lacks the description of large and relevant parts of the method (e.g., when documenting the return value, only a subset of the possible values is reported).
	1: The information in the summary is completely out of scope.

* Conciseness:
	5: The summary does not contain unneeded and trivial explanations. All text is instrumental to the code understanding.
	4: The summary features some extra explanations which may be unnecessary for most of users (e.g., defining trivial concepts such as what the intersection of two sets is).
	3: The summary features unneeded repetitions (i.e., the same concept is explained multiple times).
	2: The summary mostly features verbose explanations of information which is clearly visible in the code, such as explaining the signature. Repetitions are also present.
	1: The summary mostly features verbose explanations of information which is clearly visible in the code, such as explaining the types of parameters, the return type, etc. Repetitions are present as well as sentences explaining concepts unrelated to the code documentation (e.g., what a private method is).

* Fluency & Understandability:
	5: The summary is very easy to read and understand and does not require any specific domain knowledge to be understood.
	4: The summary is easy to read and understand but may require some specific domain knowledge to be understood.
	3: The summary is easy to read and understand for developers having expertise on that system.
	2: The summary is difficult to read and understand, but it is grammatically correct.
	1: The summary is difficult to read and understand, and grammatically incorrect.

# Evaluation Criteria & Rules
* Content adequacy:
	5: The information in the summary is correct and comprehensive. There is information which cannot be inferred by reading the signature.
	4: The information in the summary is correct, but may lack the documentation of some corner cases (e.g., exceptions). There is information which cannot be inferred by reading the signature.
	3: The information in the summary is correct, but it mostly describes the method's signature.
	2: The information in the summary is partially correct (i.e., features wrong information) and/or lacks the description of large and relevant parts of the method (e.g., when documenting the return value, only a subset of the possible values is reported).
	1: The information in the summary is completely out of scope.

* Conciseness:
	5: The summary does not contain unneeded and trivial explanations. All text is instrumental to the code understanding.
	4: The summary features some extra explanations which may be unnecessary for most of users (e.g., defining trivial concepts such as what the intersection of two sets is).
	3: The summary features unneeded repetitions (i.e., the same concept is explained multiple times).
	2: The summary mostly features verbose explanations of information which is clearly visible in the code, such as explaining the signature. Repetitions are also present.
	1: The summary mostly features verbose explanations of information which is clearly visible in the code, such as explaining the types of parameters, the return type, etc. Repetitions are present as well as sentences explaining concepts unrelated to the code documentation (e.g., what a private method is).

* Fluency & Understandability:
	5: The summary is very easy to read and understand and does not require any specific domain knowledge to be understood.
	4: The summary is easy to read and understand but may require some specific domain knowledge to be understood.
	3: The summary is easy to read and understand for developers having expertise on that system.
	2: The summary is difficult to read and understand, but it is grammatically correct.
	1: The summary is difficult to read and understand, and grammatically incorrect.

# Comment
Given an issue (as a string), extracts the number and
supplement (if it exists).  This extracts the first token as the
number (which is whatever comes before the first number in the
issue string).  If the second token in the string is ""SPECIAL"",
this assumes that the third token is the number of the special
issue.  Otherwise, this will assume that the first two tokens
are the number and the supplement.  If the supplement is
""SUPPLEMENT"", it is returned as ""0"".

Parameters
----------
issue : str

Returns
-------
number : str
The first token in the issue string if it is not equal to
""SPECIAL"".  Otherwise, this returns None.

supplement : str
The second token in the issue string if the first token is
not equal to ""SPECIAL"".  Otherwise, this returns the third
token in the string.  If the supplement is ""SUPPLEMENT"", this
returns ""0"".

In this method, we attempt to absorb `args` by first creating a (shallow) copy of `args` for efficiency.

# Comment
Absorbs the supplied arguments and returns the absorbed ones.

Note:

- All arguments will be absorbed regardless of whether they can be absorbed by `self.dual`.
- This method has an O(N^2) complexity (that is, in the worst case, this will re-evaluate `absorber` as many as `len(self)` times where `absorber` is an argument, and similarly for `target`), which should be taken care of in a method intended to perform `len(self)` absorptions (that is, one where `self` may be seen as a `self.dual` whose arguments are the `args`)

# Discussion

In this method, we attempt to absorb `args` by first creating a (shallow) copy of `args` for efficiency.

We iterate over the provided args and exit if there aren't any (that is, `args` were not supplied).  We then use `len` on `args` and use the iterator `enumerate` to get a two-dimensional iterator over `args` with indeces `[i, j]`, where `i` is the index of the first argument being enumerated and `j` is the index of the second.  We then extract `absorber` and `target` by iterating over `args[i]` using `enumerate` and similarly for `args[j]`.  If `absorber` is the same as `target`, we remove `target` from `args[j]` and if `absorber` is the negation of `target`, we add the `target` to `args[j]` and remove it from `args[j]`.  If `absorber` is not a trivial dual over one member of `args[j]`, we skip the while loop; alternatively, we would attempt to compute `~absorber` using `self.NOT(absorber)` and cancel it (that is, `self.NOT(absorber).cancel()`).

Examples:

Suppose `args = [1+2, 2 + 2, 0, -3, 5]` and `self.dual = 1-x`.  Then the first iteration of the first while loop will be over the list `[(1+2, 2+2), (

# Comment
Absorbs the supplied argument(s) into another argument.

Note:

At least one arg should be supplied. If not, args is filled with
self.args


The returned iterable has removed target arguments that could be
absorbed into at least one other arg.

For example, if the method was called on a duplicate argument, the
iterable returned by the method will only contain the argument that
was not absorbed by the other copy of the argument.

This method can remove multiple arguments in the iterable. You can
simply iterate over the iterable that is returned by this method.

If you wish to reduce only one argument, then simply wrap the
iterable in a list, and then iterate over it.

This method can return non-distinct iterables. For instance, if one
argument is found that can be absorbed into at least one argument, and
then one argument that can be absorbed into that original argument,
then the final iterable will contain two elements: one representing the
absorption of the first argument into the second argument, and another
representing the absorption of the second argument into the first
argument.

Absorb removes (dual) arguments by merging them.

Note:

The arguments that were absorbed will be returned in a new form
(as a non-simplified iterable) to make it easy to access the
differences of the arguments.


This is an aggressive simplification method, but it will not remove
any duplicative arguments. It will remove duplicate negations,
though.

# Comment
Simplify 'args' by applying absorption rules to the elements based on the properties of 'dual' and logical negations.

This method modifies the input list 'args' by iteratively comparing each element with every other, applying
logical absorption rules to reduce the list. The method makes heavy use of 'dual' property checks and logical NOT
transformations defined by 'self.NOT()' and relies on 'self.dual' to determine if elements can interact.

Each element in 'args' is tried to be absorbed into others by directly checking inclusion, or logically negating
and then checking. If an element can be absorbed into another, it is either deleted or simplified depending on the
simplification conditions provided by the method '.subtract(neg_absorber, simplify)'.

Parameters:
args (iterable): A list or other iterable that contains elements to be simplified through absorption.

Returns:
list: A simplified list of elements after applying absorption rules.

Notes:
- Elements are assumed to be able to interact with methods like 'in', '.subtract()', and logical negations
('self.NOT'). The type of these elements and the exact nature of 'self.dual' should be compatible with these
operations.
- The operation assumes no side effects outside of modifying the input 'args'.
- The method might not return the most simplified version if specific dual interactions are not defined or
if logical rules do not strictly apply as expected.

The Comment is correct and comprehensive. It does not provide information which cannot be inferred by reading the signature. It also does not feature unneeded and trivial explanations. The summary is easy to read and understand for developers having expertise on that system. However, the summary does not meet the criteria of being very easy to read and understand, as it may require some specific domain knowledge to be understood.

# Evaluation Criteria & Rules
* Content adequacy:
	5: The information in the summary is correct and comprehensive. There is information which cannot be inferred by reading the signature.
	4: The information in the summary is correct, but may lack the documentation of some corner cases (e.g., exceptions). There is information which cannot be inferred by reading the signature.
	3: The information in the summary is correct, but it mostly describes the method's signature.
	2: The information in the summary is partially correct (i.e., features wrong information) and/or lacks the description of large and relevant parts of the method (e.g., when documenting the return value, only a subset of the possible values is reported).
	1: The information in the summary is completely out of scope.

* Conciseness:
	5: The summary does not contain unneeded and trivial explanations. All text is instrumental to the code understanding.
	4: The summary features some extra explanations which may be unnecessary for most of users (e.g., defining trivial concepts such as what the intersection of two sets is).
	3: The summary features unneeded repetitions (i.e., the same concept is explained multiple times).
	2: The summary mostly features verbose explanations of information which is clearly visible in the code, such as explaining the signature. Repetitions are also present.
	1: The summary mostly features verbose explanations of information which is clearly visible in the code, such as explaining the types of parameters, the return type, etc. Repetitions are present as well as sentences explaining concepts unrelated to the code documentation (e.g., what a private method is).

* Fluency & Understandability:
	5: The summary is very easy to read and understand and does not require any specific domain knowledge to be understood.
	4: The summary is easy to read and understand but may require some specific domain knowledge to be understood.
	3: The summary is easy to read and understand for developers having expertise on that system.

# Comment
Generates a list of dictionaries representing an observable schema.

App.status.mangled_observer_schema (app.spec.observer_schema deepcopied) is updated to include any resource_manifest-specific configuration entries, as well as any child resources that do not have an explicit definition in the current observer_schema.

If a given resource_manifest does not require any additional configuration, or the configured configuration does not result in an index error, it is not added to the app.status.mangled_observer_schema. The keys in the returned list are the same as the keys in the input list, app.spec.manifest. The number of returned entries is less than or equal to the number of entries in the input list.

# Parameters
app:
An App (app)
resource_manifest:
An object of some class that inherits from spec.base.manifest.manifest.manifest
# Raises
IndexError:
Raised when a valid index is required but is not present in the specified list.

# Comment
Update the `last_applied_manifest` list with data from `response` based on the structure

This function iterates through each element in `observer_schema`, excluding the last element.
Depending on the type of each element in the schema, different operations are performed:

- If the schema element is a dictionary, the corresponding index in `last_applied_manifest`
is ensured to be a dictionary, and this method recursively updates this dictionary.
- If the corresponding element in `response` is a list, the corresponding index in
`last_applied_manifest` is ensured to be a list, and this method is called recursively.
- Otherwise, if the current index in `observer_schema` does not exist in
`last_applied_manifest`, it appends the corresponding `response` value.

Parameters:
last_applied_manifest (list): The list to update, which reflects the last state that
was successfully applied.
observer_schema (list): The schema list to guide the updating of `last_applied_manifest`.
This can include dictionaries for nested structures.
response (list): The new data values that should be used to update
`last_applied_manifest` based on `observer_schema`.

Raises:
IndexError: If the length of `last_applied_manifest` or `response` does not meet the
expectations based on `observer_schema`, although this is implicitly handled
by checks within the loops.

Returns:
None: The function updates `last_applied_manifest` in-place.

# Comment
Function `update_last_applied_manifest_list_from_resp` takes in `last_applied_manifest` of type `list`, `observer_schema` of type `list`, and `response` of type `list`.
The function recursively loops over the `observer_schema` and the `response` and updates the `last_applied_manifest` based on the types defined in the `observer_schema`.
If the `response` is longer than the `last_applied_manifest`, `last_applied_manifest` is updated with the default dictionary/list.

# Comment
Generate and return a compiled regex pattern for validating resource names.

This function utilizes a cached regex object to validate resource names based on predefined patterns,
ensuring compliance with specific character and length constraints. If the regex is already defined,
it returns the cached object; otherwise, it constructs the regex pattern, compiles it, and caches it
for future use.

Returns:
re.Pattern: A compiled regular expression object used to validate resource names.

Note:
This function modifies global variables `_resource_name_regex` and `_resource_name_pattern` to cache the regex pattern.

# Evaluation Criteria & Rules
* Content adequacy:
	5: The information in the summary is correct and comprehensive. There is information which cannot be inferred by reading the signature.
	4: The information in the summary is correct, but may lack the documentation of some corner cases (e.g., exceptions). There is information which cannot be inferred by reading the signature.
	3: The information in the summary is correct, but it mostly describes the method's signature.
	2: The information in the summary is partially correct (i.e., features wrong information) and/or lacks the description of large and relevant parts of the method (e.g., when documenting the return value, only a subset of the possible values is reported).
	1: The information in the summary is completely out of scope.

* Conciseness:
	5: The summary does not contain unneeded and trivial explanations. All text is instrumental to the code understanding.
	4: The summary features some extra explanations which may be unnecessary for most of users (e.g., defining trivial concepts such as what the intersection of two sets is).
	3: The summary features unneeded repetitions (i.e., the same concept is explained multiple times).
	2: The summary mostly features verbose explanations of information which is clearly visible in the code, such as explaining the signature. Repetitions are also present.
	1: The summary mostly features verbose explanations of information which is clearly visible in the code, such as explaining the types of parameters, the return type, etc. Repetitions are present as well as sentences explaining concepts unrelated to the code documentation (e.g., what a private method is).

* Fluency & Understandability:
	5: The summary is very easy to read and understand and does not require any specific domain knowledge to be understood.
	4: The summary is easy to read and understand but may require some specific domain knowledge to be understood.

This function inspects the input sequence and determines its type. If the sequence type is not directly
recognizable and corresponds to one of the specific handling conditions, it tries to convert the sequence
to an appropriate type based on further checks (like element checks for computed sequences). If no known
type can be assigned, it raises a LenaTypeError.

`recompute` is not used here. It's inherited from
the parent class.

Parameters
----------
other: a scale value (optional, default is None)
recompute: not used

Returns
----------
scale: a scale value (optional)

Get or change graph scale.

If another value (real number, other, not None) is given,
rescale the graph by it. This means multiplying every
coordinate by that value (that is, scaling every
coordinate by it).
If None (not a number, in the first argument), get the
current scale.

Raises
------
LenaValueError
when trying to rescale a graph with zero or unknown
scale (no one was given when creating it).

    Adjusts the coordinates of the graph if a scale factor is provided. If no scaling factor

    Parameters:
        other (float, optional): The new scale factor by which the graph's coordinates should be

    Notes:
        This method directly modifies the `coords` attribute of the graph, specifically targeting
        the last coordinate dimension. Other dimensions are not rescaled. This function relies
        heavily on internal attributes like `_scale`, `dim`, `field_names`, and methods like
        `_get_err_indices()` along with Python's functools and operator modules for efficient
        transformations.

    Example:
        Given a graph object `g` with initial scale 1.0,
        calling `g.scale(2.0)` would double the size of the graph.

This method directly modifies the `coords` attribute of the graph, specifically targeting

heavily on internal attributes like `_scale`, `dim`, `field_names`, and methods like
`_get_err_indices()` along with Python's functools and operator modules for efficient
transformations.

Given a graph object `g` with initial scale 1.0,
calling `g.scale(2.0)` would double the size of the graph.","You will be provided with a Python function (""Function"") and a textual summary of it (""Comment"").

# Comment
Rescales the graph object coordinates by a specified factor.

Adjusts the coordinates of the graph if a scale factor is provided. If no scaling factor
is given, the current scale is returned. Raises an error if the current scale is zero or undefined,
which prevents rescaling.

Parameters:
other (float, optional): The new scale factor by which the graph's coordinates should be
multiplied. If omitted or None, the current scale is returned.

Returns:
None: If a new scale is applied successfully.
float: The current scale of the graph if no new scale is provided.

Raises:
lena.core.LenaValueError: If the current scale is zero or not set, and a rescale is attempted.

# Comment
Generates a CSV string containing all points and their coordinates.

The CSV is formed by joining the values of each point separated with the *separator* argument, each value is converted to a string before being joined. *header* is an optional argument that is used to decide to whether to add a header (a string containing the keys of the first point) or not.

# Comment
Generates a graph from the histogram bins. The data items, graph coordinates,
and scaling are specified by the `field_names` and `scale` arguments.

The bins are traversed in ascending order of edges (i.e., left values).
The x values in the resulting graph are generated by:

- `get_coordinate(""left"")` - left value of the edges of each bin
- `get_coordinate(""right"")` - right value of the edges of each bin
- `get_coordinate(""middle"")` - the middle value of the edges of each bin

If the edges of a bin are identical, the resulting x values are identical.

The y values of the resulting graph are the bins.

If the `make_value` parameter is set, it is called with the bin value and
the result is inserted as the y value. Otherwise the bin value is passed
directly.

If a bin has zero value, its y value is not added to the result.

# Arguments

- `hist` (Histogram): the histogram.
- `make_value` (callable): a callable object to map the bin value to
graph y value.
- `get_coordinate` (str): ""left"", ""right"" or ""middle"" - the edges
of each bin.
- `field_names` (tuple of str or str): the field names to use in the
resulting graph.
- `scale` (Scale or None): the scaling to use in the resulting graph.

# Result

Returns a `Graph` object.

# Raises

- `lena.core.LenaValueError` - if get_coordinate is not one of ""left"", ""right"", or ""middle"".
- `lena.core.LenaTypeError` - if field_names is not a string or a tuple.

- 'left': Uses the left edge of each bin.
- 'right': Uses the right edge of each bin.
- 'middle': Uses the middle point of each bin's edges.
field_names : tuple or str, default ('x', 'y')
Names of the fields in the output graph. If a single string is provided, it will be split into tuple assuming comma-separated names.
scale : float or None, optional
A scaling factor to apply to bin values. If True, the histogram's `scale` method is invoked to determine the scaling factor. If None or not provided, no scaling is applied.

Returns:
tuple
A tuple, where each element is a list corresponding to a field specified in `field_names`. The elements of these lists are coordinates paired with transformed (or untransformed) bin values.

Raises:
lena.core.LenaValueError
If `get_coordinate` is not one of 'left', 'right', or 'middle'.
lena.core.LenaTypeError

a named tuple with fields *mean*, *mean_error* and a context
one could use

>>> make_value = lambda bin_: (bin_.mean, bin_.mean_error)

*get_coordinate* defines what the coordinate
of a graph point created from a histogram bin will be.
It can be ""left"" (default), ""right"" and ""middle"".

*field_names* set field names of the graph. Their number
must be the same as the dimension of the result.
For a *make_value* above they would be
*(""x"", ""y_mean"", ""y_mean_error"")*.

*scale* becomes the graph's scale (unknown by default).
If it is ``True``, it uses the histogram scale.

*hist* must contain only numeric bins (without context)
or *make_value* must remove context when creating a numeric graph.

Return the resulting graph.","You will be provided with a Python function (""Function"") and a textual summary of it (""Comment"").

# Comment
Convert a :class:`.histogram` to a :class:`.graph`.

*make_value* is a function to set the value of a graph's point.
By default it is bin content.
*make_value* accepts a single value (bin content) without context.

This option could be used to create graph's error bars.
For example, to create a graph with errors
from a histogram where bins contain
a named tuple with fields *mean*, *mean_error* and a context
one could use

>>> make_value = lambda bin_: (bin_.mean, bin_.mean_error)

*get_coordinate* defines what the coordinate
of a graph point created from a histogram bin will be.
It can be ""left"" (default), ""right"" and ""middle"".

*field_names* set field names of the graph. Their number
must be the same as the dimension of the result.
For a *make_value* above they would be
*(""x"", ""y_mean"", ""y_mean_error"")*.

*scale* becomes the graph's scale (unknown by default).
If it is ``True``, it uses the histogram scale.

*hist* must contain only numeric bins (without context)
or *make_value* must remove context when creating a numeric graph.

Return the resulting graph.

# Comment
Reset the histogram object.

Complexity: O(N), if the bins in this histogram were initialized with make_bins(). Otherwise, O(1).

Raises:
This method has no return value, but may raise an exception due to whatever condition caused resetting to fail.

In this method, several things need to happen. First, if the histogram object was created with a make_bins method, this method calls that make_bins method to create new bins. However, there is one complication: if the bins are not 2D, it is OK to just copy the initial bins object. However, if they are 2D, you need to make a deep copy, so you cannot just copy.

Note:

1.  It is OK if the initial bins object is itself a deep copy, because the copy function treats copy.deepcopy on an immutable object (such as a list) as a no-op.

Executes a command from a list of potential command executables with given arguments in a specified environment, 
tracks the process, and optionally handles output and errors.

Parameters:
    commands (list): A list of the command strings to attempt to execute.
    args (list): A list of arguments to pass to the command.
    cwd (str, optional): The working directory in which to execute the command. Defaults to None.
    verbose (bool, optional): If True, prints detailed error messages. Defaults to False.
    hide_stderr (bool, optional): If True, hides the standard error of the subprocess. Defaults to False.
    env (dict, optional): A dictionary of environment variables to use for the subprocess. Defaults to None.

Returns:
    tuple: A tuple containing two elements.
        - The first element is the output of the subprocess if the command was successfully executed, else None.
        - The second element is the return code of the process if the command was executed, or None if not executed.

Raises:
    OSError: If there is an error in executing the command such as command not found.

Note:
    The commands are tried in the order they are given. The process stops and returns output and status as soon
    as one of the commands runs successfully.

Example:
    stdout, returncode = run_command(['ls', 'dir'], ['-l'], cwd='/home/user', verbose=True, hide_stderr=False)

# Evaluation Criteria & Rules
* Content adequacy:
	5: The information in the summary is correct and comprehensive. There is information which cannot be inferred by reading the signature.
	4: The information in the summary is correct, but may lack the documentation of some corner cases (e.g., exceptions). There is information which cannot be inferred by reading the signature.
	3: The information in the summary is correct, but it mostly describes the method's signature.
	2: The information in the summary is partially correct (i.e., features wrong information) and/or lacks the description of large and relevant parts of the method (e.g., when documenting the return value, only a subset of the possible values is reported).
	1: The information in the summary is completely out of scope.

* Conciseness:
	5: The summary does not contain unneeded and trivial explanations. All text is instrumental to the code understanding.
	4: The summary features some extra explanations which may be unnecessary for most of users (e.g., defining trivial concepts such as what the intersection of two sets is).
	3: The summary features unneeded repetitions (i.e., the same concept is explained multiple times).
	2: The summary mostly features verbose explanations of information which is clearly visible in the code, such as explaining the signature. Repetitions are also present.
	1: The summary mostly features verbose explanations of information which is clearly visible in the code, such as explaining the types of parameters, the return type, etc. Repetitions are present as well as sentences explaining concepts unrelated to the code documentation (e.g., what a private method is).

* Fluency & Understandability:
	5: The summary is very easy to read and understand and does not require any specific domain knowledge to be understood.
	4: The summary is easy to read and understand but may require some specific domain knowledge to be understood.
	3: The summary is easy to read and understand for developers having expertise on that system.
	2: The summary is difficult to read and understand, but it is grammatically correct.

* Content adequacy:
	5: The information in the summary is correct and comprehensive. There is information which cannot be inferred by reading the signature.
	4: The information in the summary is correct, but may lack the documentation of some corner cases (e.g., exceptions). There is information which cannot be inferred by reading the signature.
	3: The information in the summary is correct, but it mostly describes the method's signature.
	2: The information in the summary is partially correct (i.e., features wrong information) and/or lacks the description of large and relevant parts of the method (e.g., when documenting the return value, only a subset of the possible values is reported).
	1: The information in the summary is completely out of scope.

* Conciseness:
	5: The summary does not contain unneeded and trivial explanations. All text is instrumental to the code understanding.
	4: The summary features some extra explanations which may be unnecessary for most of users (e.g., defining trivial concepts such as what the intersection of two sets is).
	3: The summary features unneeded repetitions (i.e., the same concept is explained multiple times).
	2: The summary mostly features verbose explanations of information which is clearly visible in the code, such as explaining the signature. Repetitions are also present.
	1: The summary mostly features verbose explanations of information which is clearly visible in the code, such as explaining the types of parameters, the return type, etc. Repetitions are present as well as sentences explaining concepts unrelated to the code documentation (e.g., what a private method is).

* Fluency & Understandability:
	5: The summary is very easy to read and understand and does not require any specific domain knowledge to be understood.
	4: The summary is easy to read and understand but may require some specific domain knowledge to be understood.
	3: The summary is easy to read and understand for developers having expertise on that system.
	2: The summary is difficult to read and understand, but it is grammatically correct.

Get version information for the current project by inspecting Git VCS tags, source directory structure,
and project configuration. This method attempts to retrieve version details based on several strategies
and returns a dictionary containing version information such as version number, revision ID, dirty status,
error messages, and date. By utilizing Git, file paths, and predefined project configurations, this method
provides an overview of the project's versioning in a structured format.

# Comment
# Docstring:
This method is a decorator function that adjusts the encoding of the return value of the provided function 'namefunc' in Python 2. If running in Python 2, it wraps the 'namefunc' function to encode the returned name. If not in Python 2, it returns the 'namefunc' function as is.

	5: The information in the summary is correct and comprehensive. There is information which cannot be inferred by reading the signature.
	4: The information in the summary is correct, but may lack the documentation of some corner cases (e.g., exceptions). There is information which cannot be inferred by reading the signature.
	3: The information in the summary is correct, but it mostly describes the method's signature.
	2: The information in the summary is partially correct (i.e., features wrong information) and/or lacks the description of large and relevant parts of the method (e.g., when documenting the return value, only a subset of the possible values is reported).
	1: The information in the summary is completely out of scope.

* Conciseness:
	5: The summary does not contain unneeded and trivial explanations. All text is instrumental to the code understanding.
	4: The summary features some extra explanations which may be unnecessary for most of users (e.g., defining trivial concepts such as what the intersection of two sets is).

Normalizes the time components of an instance by ensuring that all sub-day time measurements (hours, minutes, seconds, microseconds) align properly with the largest applicable unit without exceeding their typical maximums.

This method adjusts each time component down to the next smallest unit, carrying over any excess to the next highest unit. This ensures that values like 25 hours or 90 minutes are carried over and added properly to days or hours, respectively.

Returns:
    An instance of the same class with properly adjusted and normalized time values based on the internal representations of years, months, days, hours, minutes, seconds, and microseconds. Other date-related attributes like `leapdays`, and specific date components (`year`, `month`, `day`, and their associated time parts) are preserved and returned unaltered.

Example:
    Given an instance with the time specification that includes an overflow in smaller units (e.g., 90 minutes, 70 seconds),
    this method will return an instance where 90 minutes is transformed into 1 hour and 30 minutes, 70 seconds into 1 minute and 10 seconds, all contributing to the correct day, month, and year increment as needed.

# Evaluation Criteria & Rules
* Content adequacy:
	5: The information in the summary is correct and comprehensive. There is information which cannot be inferred by reading the signature.
	4: The information in the summary is correct, but may lack the documentation of some corner cases (e.g., exceptions). There is information which cannot be inferred by reading the signature.
	3: The information in the summary is correct, but it mostly describes the method's signature.
	2: The information in the summary is partially correct (i.e., features wrong information) and/or lacks the description of large and relevant parts of the method (e.g., when documenting the return value, only a subset of the possible values is reported).
	1: The information in the summary is completely out of scope.

* Conciseness:
	5: The summary does not contain unneeded and trivial explanations. All text is instrumental to the code understanding.
	4: The summary features some extra explanations which may be unnecessary for most of users (e.g., defining trivial concepts such as what the intersection of two sets is).
	3: The summary features unneeded repetitions (i.e., the same concept is explained multiple times).
	2: The summary mostly features verbose explanations of information which is clearly visible in the code, such as explaining the signature. Repetitions are also present.
	1: The summary mostly features verbose explanations of information which is clearly visible in the code, such as explaining the types of parameters, the return type, etc. Repetitions are present as well as sentences explaining concepts unrelated to the code documentation (e.g., what a private method is).

* Fluency & Understandability:
	5: The summary is very easy to read and understand and does not require any specific domain knowledge to be understood.

# Comment
Normalize a list of mixed sequences and an optional output.

Applies the normalizeargs operation recursively to each item of the sequence, pushing items that are either subclasses of InterfaceClass or implement the Interface class Implements onto the output list.  If an output list is provided, the normalized items will be appended to the output list.

All other items in the input sequence will be recursively normalized and appended to the output list.

To ensure efficient memory use, this method returns the output list, so it is generally recommended to pass one in.

# output = _normalizeargs([InterfaceClassImplementation(), [], 1, (), [InterfaceClassImplementation()]])

# The output list, containing the flattened and normalized input list, will contain 3 elements:

The function is used to verify that a given candidate object implements the given interface. The function does this by checking that the candidate provides the interface using ``iface.providedBy`` (unless *tentative* is `True`, in which case this step is skipped). It then makes sure the candidate defines all the necessary methods and attributes, and that the methods have the correct signature (to the extent possible).

# Comment
Verifies that a given candidate adheres to a specified interface with optional validation type.

This method checks, based on the validation type (`vtype`), whether the candidate conforms
to the interface (`iface`) either by implementation or by provision. Optional parameter
`tentative` skips certain checks to allow partial validation useful in preliminary use cases.

Args:
iface (Interface): The interface the candidate needs to verify against.
candidate (Object): The object being verified against the interface.
tentative (bool, optional): If True, performs a non-strict verification, skipping some checks.
Default is False.
vtype (str, optional): Specifies the type of validation:
'c' for checking implemented by,
else checks provided by. Default is None.

Raises:
DoesNotImplement: If the candidate does not implement or provide the required interface,
according to `vtype`.
Invalid: If an element of the interface raises a specific issue during verification.
MultipleInvalid: If multiple elements raise issues, aggregated into one exception.

Returns:
bool: Returns True if the candidate successfully passes all checks.

Notes:
This function is part of the internal API and should be used cautiously.

	3: The information in the summary is correct, but it mostly describes the method's signature.
	2: The information in the summary is partially correct (i.e., features wrong information) and/or lacks the description of large and relevant parts of the method (e.g., when documenting the return value, only a subset of the possible values is reported).
	1: The information in the summary is completely out of scope.

* Conciseness:
	5: The summary does not contain unneeded and trivial explanations. All text is instrumental to the code understanding.
	4: The summary features some extra explanations which may be unnecessary for most of users (e.g., defining trivial concepts such as what the intersection of two sets is).
	3: The summary features unneeded repetitions (i.e., the same concept is explained multiple times).

	5: The information in the summary is correct and comprehensive. There is information which cannot be inferred by reading the signature.
	4: The information in the summary is correct, but may lack the documentation of some corner cases (e.g., exceptions). There is information which cannot be inferred by reading the signature.
	3: The information in the summary is correct, but it mostly describes the method's signature.
	2: The information in the summary is partially correct (i.e., features wrong information) and/or lacks the description of large and relevant parts of the method (e.g., when documenting the return value, only a subset of the possible values is reported).
	1: The information in the summary is completely out of scope.

* Conciseness:
	5: The summary does not contain unneeded and trivial explanations. All text is instrumental to the code understanding.
	4: The summary features some extra explanations which may be unnecessary for most of users (e.g., defining trivial concepts such as what the intersection of two sets is).
	3: The summary features unneeded repetitions (i.e., the same concept is explained multiple times).
	2: The summary mostly features verbose explanations of information which is clearly visible in the code, such as explaining the signature. Repetitions are also present.
	1: The summary mostly features verbose explanations of information which is clearly visible in the code, such as explaining the types of parameters, the return type, etc. Repetitions are present as well as sentences explaining concepts unrelated to the code documentation (e.g., what a private method is).

* Fluency & Understandability:
	5: The summary is very easy to read and understand and does not require any specific domain knowledge to be understood.
	4: The summary is easy to read and understand but may require some specific domain knowledge to be understood.

>>> _legacy_mergeOrderings([[1, 2, 3], [4, 3, 2]])
[1, 4, 3, 2]

Note:
- This function treats the end of each sub-list as having the highest priority. An element appearing at the end of a later sub-list will have higher priority than if it appears at any position in a previous sub-list.
- The method uses a reversed iteration strategy for both the main list and the sub-lists to maintain the desired order.

* Content adequacy:
	5: The information in the summary is correct and comprehensive. There is information which cannot be inferred by reading the signature.
	4: The information in the summary is correct, but may lack the documentation of some corner cases (e.g., exceptions). There is information which cannot be inferred by reading the signature.
	3: The information in the summary is correct, but it mostly describes the method's signature.
	2: The information in the summary is partially correct (i.e., features wrong information) and/or lacks the description of large and relevant parts of the method (e.g., when documenting the return value, only a subset of the possible values is reported).
	1: The information in the summary is completely out of scope.

* Conciseness:
	5: The summary does not contain unneeded and trivial explanations. All text is instrumental to the code understanding.
	4: The summary features some extra explanations which may be unnecessary for most of users (e.g., defining trivial concepts such as what the intersection of two sets is).
	3: The summary features unneeded repetitions (i.e., the same concept is explained multiple times).
	2: The summary mostly features verbose explanations of information which is clearly visible in the code, such as explaining the signature. Repetitions are also present.
	1: The summary mostly features verbose explanations of information which is clearly visible in the code, such as explaining the types of parameters, the return type, etc. Repetitions are present as well as sentences explaining concepts unrelated to the code documentation (e.g., what a private method is).

    Args:
        cache (callable): Function to retrieve the caching object, which needs to support item assignment

        key (callable, optional): Function that takes the method's arguments and returns a cache key,

        lock (callable, optional): An optional lock object which can used with a `with` statement to 
            lock the method call across threads. If None, access to the cache will proceed unchecked 
            which may cause race conditions in multi-threaded environments.

# Comment
Function `cachedmethod()` is a python decorator that is used to cache the results of a method. It takes two mandatory arguments - `cache` and `key`. It is called as `@cachedmethod(cache, key=hashkey)` in the decorator. The decorator caches the results of a method in the `cache` dictionary. When a method with a given `key` is called, its results will be stored in the dictionary so it will not be called again on the next call. If the value in the cache is none, the method is called again. You have the option to pass in a lock that is used to make sure that thread safe calls are handled, such as `@cachedmethod(cache, key=hashkey, lock=RLock())`.

* Content adequacy:
	5: The information in the summary is correct and comprehensive. There is information which cannot be inferred by reading the signature.
	4: The information in the summary is correct, but may lack the documentation of some corner cases (e.g., exceptions). There is information which cannot be inferred by reading the signature.
	3: The information in the summary is correct, but it mostly describes the method's signature.
	2: The information in the summary is partially correct (i.e., features wrong information) and/or lacks the description of large and relevant parts of the method (e.g., when documenting the return value, only a subset of the possible values is reported).
	1: The information in the summary is completely out of scope.

* Conciseness:
	5: The summary does not contain unneeded and trivial explanations. All text is instrumental to the code understanding.
	4: The summary features some extra explanations which may be unnecessary for most of users (e.g., defining trivial concepts such as what the intersection of two sets is).
	3: The summary features unneeded repetitions (i.e., the same concept is explained multiple times).
	2: The summary mostly features verbose explanations of information which is clearly visible in the code, such as explaining the signature. Repetitions are also present.
	1: The summary mostly features verbose explanations of information which is clearly visible in the code, such as explaining the types of parameters, the return type, etc. Repetitions are present as well as sentences explaining concepts unrelated to the code documentation (e.g., what a private method is).

* Fluency & Understandability:
	5: The summary is very easy to read and understand and does not require any specific domain knowledge to be understood.
	4: The summary is easy to read and understand but may require some specific domain knowledge to be understood.
	3: The summary is easy to read and understand for developers having expertise on that system.
	2: The summary is difficult to read and understand, but it is grammatically correct.

# Comment
A method that will cache the result of an expensive operation.

The result is cached in a designated cache object, which is looked up
by the identity of an instance of the decorated method.

There are two alternative ways to designate the cache key: one using the built-in hash() function, and the other by supplying a custom hash key function.

# Comment
Function `cached(cache, key=hashkey, lock=None)` is a Python decorator which provides caching functionality. It takes a dictionary `cache` which is used as a cache. It also takes keyword arguments: `key` is a callable which takes any number of positional and keyword arguments (e.g. function arguments) and returns a key which identifies a cache entry. `lock` is an optional lock to prevent race conditions on the cache. The key is not used as a key if cache is None.

The decorator returns a function which wraps the original function. When the wrapped function is called it checks if a cache entry with the key generated by `key` exists in `cache`. If yes, the value is returned. If not, the key is generated and the function is called. The result of the function call is then stored in `cache` under the generated key.

If a `lock` object is supplied it is used as a `lock` to prevent race conditions on the cache. If no `lock` object is supplied the behaviour will not prevent race conditions, however two concurrent calls to the wrapped function with the same key will return the same cache entry.

It is possible for the wrapped function to raise a ValueError while trying to store the return value in `cache`, in this case the cache entry is not created.

# Comment
Generates a function wrapper that caches the result of a function.

Note:

If the provided cache is None, this decorator does nothing.

If lock is None, this decorator assumes the cache object is thread-safe. If lock is provided, this decorator uses the provided lock to ensure thread-safety.

The provided cache object should implement getitem and setitem (for caching) as well as setdefault (for ensuring thread-safety if the lock is provided).

# Comment
Execute a command with extended arguments and return its exit code and combined standard output.

This function supports conditional coloring of output, concurrency control, and platform-specific
argument length limits. It also accepts additional optional keyword arguments to pass to the command.

Parameters:
cmd (tuple[str, ...]): The base command to execute, may include initial arguments.
Must be a tuple of strings.
varargs (Sequence[str]): A sequence of strings representing additional arguments to append to the command.
color (bool): If True, enables colored output if supported by cmd_fn function.
target_concurrency (int): The maximum number of concurrent executions to run. Defaults to 1.
_max_length (int): The maximum command line length for the platform, determined by _get_platform_max_length.
Manually override this as needed per specific constraints.
**kwargs (Any): Additional keyword arguments to pass to the command execution function, such as environment variables.

Returns:
tuple[int, bytes]: A tuple containing the return code (int) and the combined standard output (bytes) of the
command executions.

Raises:
parse_shebang.ExecutableNotFoundError: If the command executable is not found.

Example:
>>> xargs(('echo', 'Hello'), ['World'], color=False)
(0, b'Hello World\n')

Note:
- On Windows platforms, certain adjustments are made when cmd ends with .bat or .cmd.
- This function is intended to simplify the handling of complex command executions that
require handling large numbers of arguments or concurrent processing.

	4: The information in the summary is correct, but may lack the documentation of some corner cases (e.g., exceptions). There is information which cannot be inferred by reading the signature.
	3: The information in the summary is correct, but it mostly describes the method's signature.
	2: The information in the summary is partially correct (i.e., features wrong information) and/or lacks the description of large and relevant parts of the method (e.g., when documenting the return value, only a subset of the possible values is reported).
	1: The information in the summary is completely out of scope.

* Conciseness:
	5: The summary does not contain unneeded and trivial explanations. All text is instrumental to the code understanding.
	4: The summary features some extra explanations which may be unnecessary for most of users (e.g., defining trivial concepts such as what the intersection of two sets is).
	3: The summary features unneeded repetitions (i.e., the same concept is explained multiple times).
	2: The summary mostly features verbose explanations of information which is clearly visible in the code, such as explaining the signature. Repetitions are also present.
	1: The summary mostly features verbose explanations of information which is clearly visible in the code, such as explaining the types of parameters, the return type, etc. Repetitions are present as well as sentences explaining concepts unrelated to the code documentation (e.g., what a private method is).

* Fluency & Understandability:
	5: The summary is very easy to read and understand and does not require any specific domain knowledge to be understood.
	4: The summary is easy to read and understand but may require some specific domain knowledge to be understood.
	3: The summary is easy to read and understand for developers having expertise on that system.

# Comment
values(*keys)
Find the values corresponding to the key, or a list of all values.

If no arguments are given, returns a list of all the values. If arguments are given, it returns the values corresponding to the keys in the list. If a key is missing, None is returned for that value.

:param keys: optional keys in the dictionary.
:return: list of values.

**Example**

# all keys
>>> dict = {'a':1, 'b':2, 'c':3}
>>> dict.values()
[1, 2, 3]

# key 'b'
>>> dict.values('b')
[2]

# key missing (missing key -> None)
>>> dict.values('d')
[None]

# no argument
>>> dict.values()
[1, 2, 3]

# args with key
>>> dict.values('a', 'c')
[1, 3]

# duplicate
>>> dict.values('a', 'a')
[1, 1]

# args without key
>>> dict.values(2, 4)
[None, None]

index(key, type=int)
Returns the index (in integers from 0 to len-1) of key in self.Rack.
If key is str, an attempt is made to index by it (that is, look in self.Rack for the index of that string).

Raises ValueError if key is not present.
Raises TypeError if key is not str nor int.

# Comment
Converts a size string with units to its equivalent in bytes.

The function supports conversion for the following units:
K (kilobytes), M (megabytes), G (gigabytes), T (terabytes),
P (petabytes), E (exabytes), Z (zettabytes), Y (yottabytes).
Each unit is considered based on a decimal system (i.e., powers of 1000).

Parameters:
size (str): A string representing the size with a number followed by a unit
(e.g., '10K', '20M'). If the string includes no unit, it is assumed
to represent direct bytes.

Returns:
int: The size converted to bytes.

Raises:
ValueError: If the input is not properly formatted or contains unsupported units.

    if verbose:
        print('Processing {}.'.format(path_name))
    processed.add(path_name)
    return False

# Comment
Takes a path_name (as a string), checks if it is already
processed. If it is it will only print to standard out
if verbose is True. If it is not in processed (a set containing all
of the processed files) it will add it to the set and print to
standard out if verbose is True, then return False to indicate it
needs to be processed further.

The path_name is a path relative to the project root (i.e.
it is a path with 'data/log' at the beginning). It should not
start with / or ./

Return True if path_name is in processed, else False

Raises
------
ValueError
path_name is not a string

* `**verbose**`:            Setting verbose output, default is False. Boolean type.
* `**processed**`:          A list of processed path.

* An explanation of the function's logic
* If there are any preconditions, postconditions, or exceptions
* A semantic transition diagram (optional)
* Any other relevant information
* A sample test case

# Function
def was_processed(processed, path_name, verbose):
    

    if path_name in processed:
        if verbose:
            print('{} has already been processed'.format(path_name))
        return True

    if verbose:
        print('Processing {}.'.format(path_name))
    processed.add(path_name)
    return False

# Comment
>>> import inspect
>>> des = inspect.getdoc(was_processed)
>>> print(des)
--------------------------------------------------


--------------------------------------------------


The docstring should end with a blank line. If there are multiple sentences, the last sentence (ending with a period) should be the summary sentence.


### Schema of `.docstring.json`:


**Required:**


* `**path_name**`:          A name to identify path. String type.
* `**verbose**`:            Setting verbose output, default is False. Boolean type.
* `**processed**`:          A list of processed path.


## The challenge:


Generate docstrings for each of the Python methods (# Python method) in the source file. Your document should describe each of the Python methods and its purpose. The docstrings should include:


* A short summary of the function's purpose
* An explanation of the function's logic
* If there are any preconditions, postconditions, or exceptions
* A semantic transition diagram (optional)
* Any other relevant information
* A sample test case


## Tips and Tricks:


1. Use docstring at the first line of function code.
2. Use six backquotes ``````(**six backquotes**) to start and end your docstring.
3. Check the differences between triple quotes """"""""""""(**triple quotes**) and six backquotes ``````(**six backquotes**) on [http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5459848/triple-quotes-vs-six-backquotes-in-python-docs](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5459848/triple-quotes-vs-six-backquotes-in-python-docs).
4. Docstring should always start and end with one blank line.
5. Use triple quotes """"""""""""(**triple quotes**) to start and end your docstring.


## Important Note:


This is not a contest. I have committed the .docstring.json file. Your task is to edit the .docstring.json file. To pass this test suite, you should write doc

# Comment
Generates a list of vertex tuples with consecutive vertices.

Appends a tuple containing the current vertex and the two consecutive vertices from the input vertices list to an initially empty list asvertex_list.
If the first and last vertices are not consecutive, an IndexError is raised; in this case, it appends a tuple containing the first and last vertices and the first vertex instead.

this is done by download the zip file via requests,
and then extracting it locally, using the tarfile library

the extracted file is returned in the function

this methods depends on Path being an instance of the builtin pathlib
class for python, to allow is to manipulate the file paths on the file
system

the method depends on tarfile to manipulate the zip file
and to extract its contents

This method returns the path where the archive is extracted

# Evaluation Criteria & Rules
* Content adequacy:
	5: The information in the summary is correct and comprehensive. There is information which cannot be inferred by reading the signature.
	4: The information in the summary is correct, but may lack the documentation of some corner cases (e.g., exceptions). There is information which cannot be inferred by reading the signature.
	3: The information in the summary is correct, but it mostly describes the method's signature.
	2: The information in the summary is partially correct (i.e., features wrong information) and/or lacks the description of large and relevant parts of the method (e.g., when documenting the return value, only a subset of the possible values is reported).
	1: The information in the summary is completely out of scope.

* Conciseness:
	5: The summary does not contain unneeded and trivial explanations. All text is instrumental to the code understanding.
	4: The summary features some extra explanations which may be unnecessary for most of users (e.g., defining trivial concepts such as what the intersection of two sets is).
	3: The summary features unneeded repetitions (i.e., the same concept is explained multiple times).
	2: The summary mostly features verbose explanations of information which is clearly visible in the code, such as explaining the signature. Repetitions are also present.
	1: The summary mostly features verbose explanations of information which is clearly visible in the code, such as explaining the types of parameters, the return type, etc. Repetitions are present as well as sentences explaining concepts unrelated to the code documentation (e.g., what a private method is).

* Fluency & Understandability:
	5: The summary is very easy to read and understand and does not require any specific domain knowledge to be understood.
	4: The summary is easy to read and understand but may require some specific domain knowledge to be understood.
	3: The summary is easy to read and understand for developers having expertise on that system.
	2: The summary is difficult to read and understand, but it is grammatically correct.

# Rationale:
This is a Python function to split a string input by a given platform.

The function first checks if the platform is 'this', if so, it will auto-detect the current platform.
Then it checks if the platform is 1, if so, it will use POSIX style.
If the platform is 0, it will use Windows/CMD style.
Otherwise, it will raise an AssertionError.

Then it splits the input str",5,5,5

# Comment
Parses a frequency string into a datetime.timedelta object that represents the frequency.

The function takes a string in the format ""N units"" where N is an integer and units can be days,
weeks, months, or years. The units are case-insensitive and can either be singular or plural.

If 'always' or an empty string is provided, the function returns None.

Parameters:
frequency (str): The frequency string describing how often an event occurs.
Examples of valid inputs include ""3 days"", ""1 month"", ""2 Years"".

Returns:
datetime.timedelta: Corresponding timedelta object that represents the frequency of the event.
Adjustments are made such that ""month"" and ""year"" are approximated in terms
of weeks and days, respectively (1 month = 4 weeks, 1 year = 365 days).

Raises:
ValueError: If the input string does not conform to the expected format, or if an unsupported
time unit is provided.

Examples:
>>> parse_frequency('10 days')
datetime.timedelta(days=10)

>>> parse_frequency('1 year')
datetime.timedelta(days=365)

>>> parse_frequency('')
None

>>> parse_frequency('Always')

# Evaluation Criteria & Rules
* Content adequacy:
	5: The information in the summary is correct and comprehensive. There is information which cannot be inferred by reading the signature.
	4: The information in the summary is correct, but may lack the documentation of some corner cases (e.g., exceptions). There is information which cannot be inferred by reading the signature.
	3: The information in the summary is correct, but it mostly describes the method's signature.
	2: The information in the summary is partially correct (i.e., features wrong information) and/or lacks the description of large and relevant parts of the method (e.g., when documenting the return value, only a subset of the possible values is reported).
	1: The information in the summary is completely out of scope.

* Conciseness:
	5: The summary does not contain unneeded and trivial explanations. All text is instrumental to the code understanding.
	4: The summary features some extra explanations which may be unnecessary for most of users (e.g., defining trivial concepts such as what the intersection of two sets is).
	3: The summary features unneeded repetitions (i.e., the same concept is explained multiple times).
	2: The summary mostly features verbose explanations of information which is clearly visible in the code, such as explaining the signature. Repetitions are also present.
	1: The summary mostly features verbose explanations of information which is clearly visible in the code, such as explaining the types of parameters, the return type, etc. Repetitions are present as well as sentences explaining concepts unrelated to the code documentation (e.g., what a private method is).

* Fluency & Understandability:
	5: The summary is very easy to read and understand and does not require any specific domain knowledge to be understood.
	4: The summary is easy to read and understand but may require some specific domain knowledge to be understood.
	3: The summary is easy to read and understand for developers having expertise on that system.
	2: The summary is difficult to read and understand, but it is grammatically correct.

* Content adequacy:
	5: The information in the summary is correct and comprehensive. There is information which cannot be inferred by reading the signature.
	4: The information in the summary is correct, but may lack the documentation of some corner cases (e.g., exceptions). There is information which cannot be inferred by reading the signature.
	3: The information in the summary is correct, but it mostly describes the method's signature.
	2: The information in the summary is partially correct (i.e., features wrong information) and/or lacks the description of large and relevant parts of the method (e.g., when documenting the return value, only a subset of the possible values is reported).
	1: The information in the summary is completely out of scope.

* Conciseness:
	5: The summary does not contain unneeded and trivial explanations. All text is instrumental to the code understanding.
	4: The summary features some extra explanations which may be unnecessary for most of users (e.g., defining trivial concepts such as what the intersection of two sets is).
	3: The summary features unneeded repetitions (i.e., the same concept is explained multiple times).
	2: The summary mostly features verbose explanations of information which is clearly visible in the code, such as explaining the signature. Repetitions are also present.
	1: The summary mostly features verbose explanations of information which is clearly visible in the code, such as explaining the types of parameters, the return type, etc. Repetitions are present as well as sentences explaining concepts unrelated to the code documentation (e.g., what a private method is).

* Fluency & Understandability:
	5: The summary is very easy to read and understand and does not require any specific domain knowledge to be understood.
	4: The summary is easy to read and understand but may require some specific domain knowledge to be understood.
	3: The summary is easy to read and understand for developers having expertise on that system.

# Answer
(5, 4, 4)

# Explanation
The function runs a command in a subprocess from a list of possible commands. It returns the output and status code of the command. The function also takes several optional arguments that can influence command execution, such as the current working directory, whether to hide the standard error, and a dictionary of environment variables.

The comment is generally well-written and provides a clear description of the function's purpose and behavior. It mentions the",5,4,4

# Comment
Function `find_roots` Find the roots of a property.

Note:

At the first call `roots=None`. The returned value is the root triples. For next calls
the `roots` are updated as follow `roots = find_roots(graph, prop, roots)`.

`graph` -- (rdflib.Graph): the rdflib graph object.

`prop` -- (rdflib.URIRef): the property.

`roots` -- (Optional[Set[rdflib.Node]]): the roots.

Returns:

(Set[rdflib.Node]): the roots of the property.

Example:

>>> from rdflib import Graph
>>> from rdflib import URIRef
>>> g = Graph()
>>> g.add((URIRef(""http://example.org/a""), URIRef(""http://example.org/b""), URIRef(""http://example.org/c"")))
>>> g.add((URIRef(""http://example.org/c""), URIRef(""http://example.org/b""), URIRef(""http://example.org/d"")))
>>> roots = find_roots(g, URIRef(""http://example.org/b""))
>>> roots
set({URIRef(""http://example.org/c""), URIRef(""http://example.org/d"")})
>>> roots = find_roots(g, URIRef(""http://example.org/b""), roots)
>>> roots
set({URIRef(""http://example.org/d"")})

# Comment
Creates and configures a rotating file logger.

This function sets up a logger that outputs logs to a file which will rotate
when the log size exceeds a specific threshold. The logs are stored inside a directory.

Arguments:
name (str): Name of the logger, defaults to 'app'.
logfile (str): Name of the file to log to, defaults to 'app.log'.
debug (bool): If True, sets the logger to DEBUG level, otherwise INFO level; defaults to True.

Returns:
logging.Logger: Configured logger with a rotating file handler.

Note:
Log directory is hardcoded as './logs' and should ideally be configured outside this function.
The log file will rotate when it reaches 10 MB and a maximum of 100 backup files will be kept.

# Comment
Function `load_configurations(config_filenames, overrides=None, resolve_env=True)`.
Function takes a list of configuration file names `config_filenames` to be
used to parse and validate configuration objects, as well as any overrides that
should be applied (e.g. to allow for testing).

All configuration files in `config_filenames` are first attempted to be
opened for reading and are then parsed with `validate.parse_configuration()`
using the schema located at `validate.schema_filename()` (which is itself read
in from a file). Any parse errors are logged at level `logging.CRITICAL`, as
the program should not continue if it is unable to read and validate the
configuration.

Once all configuration files have been parsed and any errors have been
encountered, any additional `overrides` that should be applied are
applied to each configuration as a `dict` to enable nested attribute
overrides. If `resolve_env` is `True` (as it is by default), any environment
variables in the overrides are also resolved before being applied.

Configuration objects are read into a `collections.OrderedDict` and any
configuration file-related log information is stored in a `list` before
returning that `dict` and `list` of logs back to the caller of the function.

While not particularly important for the purpose of this exercise, be
aware that the configuration objects generated by this function can be
accessed from each program module for use as needed, and there can be a
considerable amount of convenience and reliability gained by using a
program-global, `thread-local` configuration object. This can also be
disabled for use in testing.

Any configuration file-related problems encountered during the
loading process will be logged at level `logging.WARNING`. Any other
errors encountered will be logged at level `logging.CRITICAL`. Both are
considered important enough to take action on.

# Explanation:
The comment is generally accurate and informative. It covers the function's purpose and how it works. It does not contain any information which cannot be inferred by reading the signature.

The comment could be more concise. It could also be more concise in some parts, but it is generally easy to read and understand. It is grammatically correct.

# Evaluation Criteria & Rules
* Content adequacy:
	5: The information in the summary is correct and comprehensive. There is information which cannot be inferred by reading the signature.
	4: The information in the summary is correct, but may lack the documentation of some corner cases (e.g., exceptions). There is information which cannot be inferred by reading the signature.
	3: The information in the summary is correct, but it mostly describes the method's signature.
	2: The information in the summary is partially correct (i.e., features wrong information) and/or lacks the description of large and relevant parts of the method (e.g., when documenting the return value, only a subset of the possible values is reported).
	1: The information in the summary is completely out of scope.

* Conciseness:
	5: The summary does not contain unneeded and trivial explanations. All text is instrumental to the code understanding.
	4: The summary features some extra explanations which may be unnecessary for most of users (e.g., defining trivial concepts such as what the intersection of two sets is).
	3: The summary features unneeded repetitions (i.e., the same concept is explained multiple times).
	2: The summary mostly features verbose explanations of information which is clearly visible in the code, such as explaining the signature. Repetitions are also present.
	1: The summary mostly features verbose explanations of information which is clearly visible in the code, such as explaining the types of parameters, the return type, etc. Repetitions are present as well as sentences explaining concepts unrelated to the code documentation (e.g., what a private method is).

* Fluency & Understandability:
	5: The summary is very easy to read and understand and does not require any specific domain knowledge to be understood.
	4: The summary is easy to read and understand but may require some specific domain knowledge to be understood.
	3: The summary is easy to read and understand for developers having expertise on that system.
	2: The summary is difficult to read and understand, but it is grammatically correct.

# Comment
Insert or update a value in a nested dictionary structure.

This function allows deeply nested updates in a dictionary by specifying a sequence of keys.
It supports merging dictionaries at the nested level.

Parameters:
- dic (dict): The dictionary into which the value will be inserted or updated.
- val (any): The value to insert or merge into the dictionary.
- key (str): The first level key under which the value should be inserted.
- *keys (str): Optional sequence of subkeys defining the path at deeper levels in the dictionary where the value should be placed.

If `dic` is None, the function does nothing. If no further `keys` are provided, the value is inserted at the level of `key`.
If a further sequence of `keys` is provided, the function recursively prepares the structure of nested dictionaries up to the final key,
where the value is then placed. If existing entries at target position are dictionaries, and the new value is also a dictionary,
a merge is executed instead of a simple overwrite.

Returns:
None: This function modifies the dictionary in-place and returns None.

Example:
>>> d = {}
>>> dict_insert(d, 10, 'x', 'y', 'z')
>>> assert d == {'x': {'y': {'z': 10}}}

>>> e = {'a': {'b': {'c': 3}}}
>>> dict_insert(e, {'d': 4}, 'a', 'b')
>>> assert e == {'a': {'b': {'c': 3, 'd': 4}}}

## Description

You're given a dictionary, where the outermost level is expected to be a `dict` and, not mandatory, each subdictionary is also a `dict`.
The function `insert_in_dict` takes `dic` (that is, the dictionary) as a first argument, `val` (that is, the value) as a second argument, `key` (that is, the key) as a third argument, and finally, the remaining keys are passed as variadic arguments.
The `val` argument may not be a dictionary; if it is, then, it is expected to be merged into the resulting subdictionary.
If the `val` argument is a dictionary and the value of the `key` argument is not a `dict`, then the value of the key is not present in the outermost `dict`, and this value is used instead of the original value.
In general, if the `val` argument is a `dict`, the function expects the value of `key` to also be a `dict` (as the `insert_in_dict` method can be nested).
If the value of the `key` is a `dict`, the function merges the values of `val` with the corresponding value in the dictionary.
If the value of the `key` is not a `dict`, the value of the `key` is overwritten with the new `val` value.
The resulting dictionaries are always flattened, so the returned dictionary will only contain one level of nesting (the contents of the outermost `dict`).

## Functionality

The function is designed to provide a way to modify a dictionary by inserting, updating or adding values to nested dictionaries.
The function can also be used to merge values into the nested dictionaries by passing a dictionary to be added.

## Example Usage

Example usage of `insert_in_dict` without using any nested dictionaries (i.e., without the values being dictionaries) might look something like this:

    outer_dic = {'a': 'a_val', 'b': 'b_val'}
    insert_in_dict(outer_dic, 'c', 'c_val')
    print(outer_dic)

The output of the above code might look like this:

Your role is to evaluate the Comment across three criteria on a scale from 1 to 5, providing as output for each of them a rating (# Rating) as described in the following, and no other text.

# Evaluation Criteria & Rules
* Content adequacy:
	5: The information in the summary is correct and comprehensive. There is information which cannot be inferred by reading the signature.
	4: The information in the summary is correct, but may lack the documentation of some corner cases (e.g., exceptions). There is information which cannot be inferred by reading the signature.
	3: The information in the summary is correct, but it mostly describes the method's signature.
	2: The information in the summary is partially correct (i.e., features wrong information) and/or lacks the description of large and relevant parts of the method (e.g., when documenting the return value, only a subset of the possible values is reported).
	1: The information in the summary is completely out of scope.

* Conciseness:
	5: The summary does not contain unneeded and trivial explanations. All text is instrumental to the code understanding.
	4: The summary features some extra explanations which may be unnecessary for most of users (e.g., defining trivial concepts such as what the intersection of two sets is).
	3: The summary features unneeded repetitions (i.e., the same concept is explained multiple times).
	2: The summary mostly features verbose explanations of information which is clearly visible in the code, such as explaining the signature. Repetitions are also present.
	1: The summary mostly features verbose explanations of information which is clearly visible in the code, such as explaining the types of parameters, the return type, etc. Repetitions are present as well as sentences explaining concepts unrelated to the code documentation (e.g., what a private method is).

* Fluency & Understandability:
	5: The summary is very easy to read and understand and does not require any specific domain knowledge to be understood.
	4: The summary is easy to read and understand but may require some specific domain knowledge to be understood.
	3: The summary is easy to read and understand for developers having expertise on that system.
	2: The summary is difficult to read and understand, but it is grammatically correct.
	1: The summary is difficult to read and understand, and grammatically incorrect.

# Comment
Validates and handles the deprecation of command line and answer file arguments.

This method iterates over deprecated arguments and their replacements as defined
by `get_deprecated_args()` method. If a deprecated argument appears in the command
line or answer file arguments, it raises an exception if both deprecated and new
argument exist, and logs a warning. It also replaces the deprecated argument's value
with the value of the newly introduced argument in both command line and answer file
dictionaries.

Args:
cli_args (dict): A dictionary containing command line arguments where each key
is a command and the value is another dictionary of arguments.
answer_file_args (dict): A dictionary similar to `cli_args` but sourced from an
answer file.

Raises:
IRDeprecationException: If a deprecated argument and its replacement are found
within the same set of arguments.

Returns:
dict: The updated dictionary of command line arguments with deprecated arguments
replaced by their new counterparts.

Notes:
This function directly modifies the content of the `cli_args` argument by reference.

# Evaluation Criteria & Rules
* Content adequacy:
	5: The information in the summary is correct and comprehensive. There is information which cannot be inferred by reading the signature.
	4: The information in the summary is correct, but may lack the documentation of some corner cases (e.g., exceptions). There is information which cannot be inferred by reading the signature.
	3: The information in the summary is correct, but it mostly describes the method's signature.
	2: The information in the summary is partially correct (i.e., features wrong information) and/or lacks the description of large and relevant parts of the method (e.g., when documenting the return value, only a subset of the possible values is reported).
	1: The information in the summary is completely out of scope.

* Conciseness:
	5: The summary does not contain unneeded and trivial explanations. All text is instrumental to the code understanding.
	4: The summary features some extra explanations which may be unnecessary for most of users (e.g., defining trivial concepts such as what the intersection of two sets is).
	3: The summary features unneeded repetitions (i.e., the same concept is explained multiple times).
	2: The summary mostly features verbose explanations of information which is clearly visible in the code, such as explaining the signature. Repetitions are also present.
	1: The summary mostly features verbose explanations of information which is clearly visible in the code, such as explaining the types of parameters, the return type, etc. Repetitions are present as well as sentences explaining concepts unrelated to the code documentation (e.g., what a private method is).

* Fluency & Understandability:
	5: The summary is very easy to read and understand and does not require any specific domain knowledge to be understood.
	4: The summary is easy to read and understand but may require some specific domain knowledge to be understood.
	3: The summary is easy to read and understand for developers having expertise on that system.
	2: The summary is difficult to read and understand, but it is grammatically correct.

# Evaluation Criteria & Rules
* Content adequacy:
	5: The information in the summary is correct and comprehensive. There is information which cannot be inferred by reading the signature.
	4: The information in the summary is correct, but may lack the documentation of some corner cases (e.g., exceptions). There is information which cannot be inferred by reading the signature.
	3: The information in the summary is correct, but it mostly describes the method's signature.
	2: The information in the summary is partially correct (i.e., features wrong information) and/or lacks the description of large and relevant parts of the method (e.g., when documenting the return value, only a subset of the possible values is reported).
	1: The information in the summary is completely out of scope.

* Conciseness:
	5: The summary does not contain unneeded and trivial explanations. All text is instrumental to the code understanding.
	4: The summary features some extra explanations which may be unnecessary for most of users (e.g., defining trivial concepts such as what the intersection of two sets is).
	3: The summary features unneeded repetitions (i.e., the same concept is explained multiple times).
	2: The summary mostly features verbose explanations of information which is clearly visible in the code, such as explaining the signature. Repetitions are also present.
	1: The summary mostly features verbose explanations of information which is clearly visible in the code, such as explaining the types of parameters, the return type, etc. Repetitions are present as well as sentences explaining concepts unrelated to the code documentation (e.g., what a private method is).

* Fluency & Understandability:
	5: The summary is very easy to read and understand and does not require any specific domain knowledge to be understood.
	4: The summary is easy to read and understand but may require some specific domain knowledge to be understood.
	3: The summary is easy to read and understand for developers having expertise on that system.
	2: The summary is difficult to read and understand, but it is grammatically correct.
	1: The summary is difficult to read and understand, and grammatically incorrect.

Split input arguments to control nested and custom.

Controls arguments: control the IR behavior. These arguments
will not be put into the spec yml file
Nested arguments: are used by the Ansible playbooks and will be put
into the spec yml file.
Custom arguments: Custom ansible variables to be used instead of the
normal nested usage.

:param args: the collected list of args.
:return: (dict, dict): flat dicts (control_args, nested_args)

# Comment
Generates nested arguments from the passed in ansible variable.

Nested arguments are any arguments in the format k:v (as a dictionary),
and ansible variable is assigned by the variable ansible_variable key
of the arg spec.

The nested values are built into a nested dictionary (suitable for running
the is nested method later.)

At the same time control arguments are returned along side with the nested
arguments so that the method returns values like ({nested: {}}, {control_args:
{}})

	3: The information in the summary is correct, but it mostly describes the method's signature.
	2: The information in the summary is partially correct (i.e., features wrong information) and/or lacks the description of large and relevant parts of the method (e.g., when documenting the return value, only a subset of the possible values is reported).
	1: The information in the summary is completely out of scope.

* Conciseness:
	5: The summary does not contain unneeded and trivial explanations. All text is instrumental to the code understanding.
	4: The summary features some extra explanations which may be unnecessary for most of users (e.g., defining trivial concepts such as what the intersection of two sets is).
	3: The summary features unneeded repetitions (i.e., the same concept is explained multiple times).
	2: The summary mostly features verbose explanations of information which is clearly visible in the code, such as explaining the signature. Repetitions are also present.
	1: The summary mostly features verbose explanations of information which is clearly visible in the code, such as explaining the types of parameters, the return type, etc. Repetitions are present as well as sentences explaining concepts unrelated to the code documentation (e.g., what a private method is).

* Fluency & Understandability:
	5: The summary is very easy to read and understand and does not require any specific domain knowledge to be understood.

Executes an Ansible playbook with specified configuration and arguments.

This method runs an Ansible playbook using a given path and includes capabilities for setting verbosity, additional variables, and other Ansible-specific arguments.

Parameters:
    ir_workspace (Workspace): An instance of the Workspace class which includes necessary configurations such as inventory.
    ir_plugin (Plugin): An instance of the Plugin class related to the current playbook execution.
    playbook_path (str): The file path to the Ansible playbook that needs to be executed.
    verbose (int, optional): The verbosity level for the execution output. Defaults to None, which means no verbose output.
    extra_vars (dict, optional): A dictionary of extra variables to be passed to the playbook. Defaults to None.
    ansible_args (list, optional): Additional command-line arguments to pass to the ansible-playbook command. Defaults to an empty list.

Returns:
    object: Depending on the implementation of _run_playbook, typically the result of the playbook execution, which could be success, failure, or detailed results.

Raises:
    VariousErrors: Depending on the implementation and Ansible setup, several different errors could be raised. 

Notes:
    - LOG is assumed to be a pre-configured logger within this module.
    - _run_playbook is a presumed internal method handling the playbook execution details.
    - The method directly sets the 'display' attribute on the main module for Ansible's verbosity management.

# Evaluation Criteria & Rules
* Content adequacy:
	5: The information in the summary is correct and comprehensive. There is information which cannot be inferred by reading the signature.
	4: The information in the summary is correct, but may lack the documentation of some corner cases (e.g., exceptions). There is information which cannot be inferred by reading the signature.
	3: The information in the summary is correct, but it mostly describes the method's signature.
	2: The information in the summary is partially correct (i.e., features wrong information) and/or lacks the description of large and relevant parts of the method (e.g., when documenting the return value, only a subset of the possible values is reported).
	1: The information in the summary is completely out of scope.

* Conciseness:
	5: The summary does not contain unneeded and trivial explanations. All text is instrumental to the code understanding.
	4: The summary features some extra explanations which may be unnecessary for most of users (e.g., defining trivial concepts such as what the intersection of two sets is).
	3: The summary features unneeded repetitions (i.e., the same concept is explained multiple times).
	2: The summary mostly features verbose explanations of information which is clearly visible in the code, such as explaining the signature. Repetitions are also present.
	1: The summary mostly features verbose explanations of information which is clearly visible in the code, such as explaining the types of parameters, the return type, etc. Repetitions are present as well as sentences explaining concepts unrelated to the code documentation (e.g., what a private method is).

* Fluency & Understandability:
	5: The summary is very easy to read and understand and does not require any specific domain knowledge to be understood.
	4: The summary is easy to read and understand but may require some specific domain knowledge to be understood.
	3: The summary is easy to read and understand for developers having expertise on that system.
	2: The summary is difficult to read and understand, but it is grammatically correct.
	1: The summary is difficult to read and understand, and grammatically incorrect.

# Comment
Executes an Ansible playbook based on the supplied command-line arguments, variable dictionary, workspace, and plugin information.

This method dynamically extends the command line arguments to include extra variables from a temporary YAML file
and potentially additional runtime information if specified by the environment. It handles setting up output
and log files based on the runtime environment and captures Ansible's output according to specified configurations.

Errors during Ansible command line parsing or playbook execution are logged and raised.

Args:
cli_args (list): The command line arguments to pass to Ansible CLI.
vars_dict (dict): Dictionary of variables to pass to the Ansible playbook.
ir_workspace (object): The Infrared Workspace object containing paths for outputs and variables.
ir_plugin (object): Plugin object containing metadata about the current plugin being executed.

Raises:
AnsibleParserError: If there is an error while parsing the playbook.
AnsibleOptionsError: If there is an issue with the options passed to Ansible.

Returns:
int: The return code from the Ansible CLI execution.

Your role is to evaluate the Comment across three criteria on a scale from 1 to 5, providing as output for each of them a rating (# Rating) as described in the following, and no other text.

# Evaluation Criteria & Rules
* Content adequacy:
	5: The information in the summary is correct and comprehensive. There is information which cannot be inferred by reading the signature.
	4: The information in the summary is correct, but may lack the documentation of some corner cases (e.g., exceptions). There is information which cannot be inferred by reading the signature.
	3: The information in the summary is correct, but it mostly describes the method's signature.
	2: The information in the summary is partially correct (i.e., features wrong information) and/or lacks the description of large and relevant parts of the method (e.g., when documenting the return value, only a subset of the possible values is reported).
	1: The information in the summary is completely out of scope.

* Conciseness:
	5: The summary does not contain unneeded and trivial explanations. All text is instrumental to the code understanding.
	4: The summary features some extra explanations which may be unnecessary for most of users (e.g., defining trivial concepts such as what the intersection of two sets is).
	3: The summary features unneeded repetitions (i.e., the same concept is explained multiple times).
	2: The summary mostly features verbose explanations of information which is clearly visible in the code, such as explaining the signature. Repetitions are also present.
	1: The summary mostly features verbose explanations of information which is clearly visible in the code, such as explaining the types of parameters, the return type, etc. Repetitions are present as well as sentences explaining concepts unrelated to the code documentation (e.g., what a private method is).

* Fluency & Understandability:
	5: The summary is very easy to read and understand and does not require any specific domain knowledge to be understood.
	4: The summary is easy to read and understand but may require some specific domain knowledge to be understood.
	3: The summary is easy to read and understand for developers having expertise on that system.
	2: The summary is difficult to read and understand, but it is grammatically correct.
	1: The summary is difficult to read and understand, and grammatically incorrect.

* Content adequacy:
	5: The information in the summary is correct and comprehensive. There is information which cannot be inferred by reading the signature.
	4: The information in the summary is correct, but may lack the documentation of some corner cases (e.g., exceptions). There is information which cannot be inferred by reading the signature.
	3: The information in the summary is correct, but it mostly describes the method's signature.
	2: The information in the summary is partially correct (i.e., features wrong information) and/or lacks the description of large and relevant parts of the method (e.g., when documenting the return value, only a subset of the possible values is reported).
	1: The information in the summary is completely out of scope.

* Conciseness:
	5: The summary does not contain unneeded and trivial explanations. All text is instrumental to the code understanding.
	4: The summary features some extra explanations which may be unnecessary for most of users (e.g., defining trivial concepts such as what the intersection of two sets is).
	3: The summary features unneeded repetitions (i.e., the same concept is explained multiple times).
	2: The summary mostly features verbose explanations of information which is clearly visible in the code, such as explaining the signature. Repetitions are also present.
	1: The summary mostly features verbose explanations of information which is clearly visible in the code, such as explaining the types of parameters, the return type, etc. Repetitions are present as well as sentences explaining concepts unrelated to the code documentation (e.g., what a private method is).

* Fluency & Understandability:
	5: The summary is very easy to read and understand and does not require any specific domain knowledge to be understood.
	4: The summary is easy to read and understand but may require some specific domain knowledge to be understood.
	3: The summary is easy to read and understand for developers having expertise on that system.
	2: The summary is difficult to read and understand, but it is grammatically correct.

The goal of the Comment is to document the functionality implemented in the Function. Your role is to evaluate the Comment across three criteria on a scale from 1 to 5, providing as output for each of them a rating (# Rating) as described in the following, and no other text.

# Evaluation Criteria & Rules
* Content adequacy:
	5: The information in the summary is correct and comprehensive. There is information which cannot be inferred by reading the signature.
	4: The information in the summary is correct, but may lack the documentation of some corner cases (e.g., exceptions). There is information which cannot be inferred by reading the signature.
	3: The information in the summary is correct, but it mostly describes the method's signature.
	2: The information in the summary is partially correct (i.e., features wrong information) and/or lacks the description of large and relevant parts of the method (e.g., when documenting the return value, only a subset of the possible values is reported).
	1: The information in the summary is completely out of scope.

* Conciseness:
	5: The summary does not contain unneeded and trivial explanations. All text is instrumental to the code understanding.
	4: The summary features some extra explanations which may be unnecessary for most of users (e.g., defining trivial concepts such as what the intersection of two sets is).
	3: The summary features unneeded repetitions (i.e., the same concept is explained multiple times).
	2: The summary mostly features verbose explanations of information which is clearly visible in the code, such as explaining the signature. Repetitions are also present.
	1: The summary mostly features verbose explanations of information which is clearly visible in the code, such as explaining the types of parameters, the return type, etc. Repetitions are present as well as sentences explaining concepts unrelated to the code documentation (e.g., what a private method is).

* Fluency & Understandability:
	5: The summary is very easy to read and understand and does not require any specific domain knowledge to be understood.
	4: The summary is easy to read and understand but may require some specific domain knowledge to be understood.
	3: The summary is easy to read and understand for developers having expertise on that system.
	2: The summary is difficult to read and understand, but it is grammatically correct.
	1: The summary is difficult to read and understand, and grammatically incorrect.

# Comment
Run a playbook using the passed in ansible cli args and variable dictionary. If the environment variable `IR_ANSIBLE_NO_STDOUT` is set, `sys.stdout` will not be redirected. If the environment variable `IR_ANSIBLE_NO_STDERR` is set, `sys.stderr` will not be redirected. Ansible should have been imported before this method is called.

Important environment variables used by this method:

* IR_ANSIBLE_NO_STDERR
* IR_ANSIBLE_NO_STDOUT
* IR_ANSIBLE_LOG_OUTPUT
* IR_ANSIBLE_LOG_OUTPUT_NO_ANSI

If environment variable `IR_NO_EXTRAS` is not set, ir related variables are added to the passed in variable dictionary.

If environment variable `IR_GEN_VARS_JSON` is set, the json representation of the passed in variable dictionary will be saved to the `ansible_vars` directory, using the format `<plugin name>_<timestamp>.json`.

# arguments:

* **cli_args** (_List[Union[str, bytes, unicode]]_) -- the ansible cli args to be passed to `ansible-playbook`
* **vars_dict** (_Dict[str, Union[str, int, List[Union[str, bytes, unicode]], Dict[str, Union[str, int, List[Union[str, bytes, unicode]], Dict[str, Union[str, int, List[Union[str, bytes, unicode]], Dict[str, ...]]]]]]]_) -- the variables to be passed to the playbook
* **ir_workspace** (_Workspace_) -- the infrared workspace
* **ir_plugin** (_BasePlugin_) -- the infrared plugin

# returns:

_Any_ -- return code of the invoked playbook

# Evaluation Criteria & Rules
* Content adequacy:
	5: The information in the summary is correct and comprehensive. There is information which cannot be inferred by reading the signature.
	4: The information in the summary is correct, but may lack the documentation of some corner cases (e.g., exceptions). There is information which cannot be inferred by reading the signature.
	3: The information in the summary is correct, but it mostly describes the method's signature.
	2: The information in the summary is partially correct (i.e., features wrong information) and/or lacks the description of large and relevant parts of the method (e.g., when documenting the return value, only a subset of the possible values is reported).
	1: The information in the summary is completely out of scope.

* Conciseness:
	5: The summary does not contain unneeded and trivial explanations. All text is instrumental to the code understanding.
	4: The summary features some extra explanations which may be unnecessary for most of users (e.g., defining trivial concepts such as what the intersection of two sets is).
	3: The summary features unneeded repetitions (i.e., the same concept is explained multiple times).
	2: The summary mostly features verbose explanations of information which is clearly visible in the code, such as explaining the signature. Repetitions are also present.
	1: The summary mostly features verbose explanations of information which is clearly visible in the code, such as explaining the types of parameters, the return type, etc. Repetitions are present as well as sentences explaining concepts unrelated to the code documentation (e.g., what a private method is).

* Fluency & Understandability:
	5: The summary is very easy to read and understand and does not require any specific domain knowledge to be understood.
	4: The summary is easy to read and understand but may require some specific domain knowledge to be understood.
	3: The summary is easy to read and understand for developers having expertise on that system.
	2: The summary is difficult to read and understand, but it is grammatically correct.

# Comment
Generates a list of dictionaries and an implicit parsing step to enhance the CLI interface

# Arguments
- `self` - an instance of ConfigParserApp

- `parser_name` - the name of the parser to be updated

- `values_dict` - dictionary holding (commandline option name, commandline option value) pairs

# Returns
- `values_dict` - dictionary holding (commandline option name, commandline option value) pairs after processing

# Method Description

This method is called from the parse_config() method to check the values provided to CLI options,
find whether they are an integer and parse them to integers, if needed. Also, this method calls
the self.spec_helper.get_option_spec() method to get the necessary information about the CLI
option that is to be processed.

Parameters
----------
plugin_dir : pathlib.Path
    The directory of the plugin.

Returns
-------
dict
    A dictionary with the same keys as the `PluginSpec` defined
    in the `kedro.framework.session.store` module.

Raises
------
FileNotFoundError
    If the specified `plugin_dir` does not have a plugin.yaml.

Example:

is mainly being used for type hinting purposes, it is not
necessarily a loss, but it is something to be aware of.

* Content adequacy:
	5: The information in the summary is correct and comprehensive. There is information which cannot be inferred by reading the signature.
	4: The information in the summary is correct, but may lack the documentation of some corner cases (e.g., exceptions). There is information which cannot be inferred by reading the signature.
	3: The information in the summary is correct, but it mostly describes the method's signature.
	2: The information in the summary is partially correct (i.e., features wrong information) and/or lacks the description of large and relevant parts of the method (e.g., when documenting the return value, only a subset of the possible values is reported).
	1: The information in the summary is completely out of scope.

* Conciseness:
	5: The summary does not contain unneeded and trivial explanations. All text is instrumental to the code understanding.
	4: The summary features some extra explanations which may be unnecessary for most of users (e.g., defining trivial concepts such as what the intersection of two sets is).
	3: The summary features unneeded repetitions (i.e., the same concept is explained multiple times).
	2: The summary mostly features verbose explanations of information which is clearly visible in the code, such as explaining the signature. Repetitions are also present.
	1: The summary mostly features verbose explanations of information which is clearly visible in the code, such as explaining the types of parameters, the return type, etc. Repetitions are present as well as sentences explaining concepts unrelated to the code documentation (e.g., what a private method is).

* Fluency & Understandability:
	5: The summary is very easy to read and understand and does not require any specific domain knowledge to be understood.
	4: The summary is easy to read and understand but may require some specific domain knowledge to be understood.
	3: The summary is easy to read and understand for developers having expertise on that system.

# Comment
Determines whether the provided request contains specific data structures.

This function attempts to determine if a given request contains either a JSON object with a key ""encrypted_magic_envelope"" or an XML element with a tag matching `MAGIC_ENV_TAG`. The request body is expected to possibly be in bytes, which it attempts to decode for JSON, and in text, which it encodes for XML parsing.

Args:
request (RequestType): The request object containing the data, usually including a body attribute that is either in bytes or string format.

Returns:
bool: True if the request contains the specified JSON key or XML tag, False otherwise.

Raises:
Exception: Does not explicitly raise exceptions but catches them to return False if any anomalies occur during processing.

# Explanation
This code is a function to check whether the request is a well-formed Magic Envelope request. The function checks whether the input request represents a well-formed Magic Envelope request by checking whether the `encrypted_magic_envelope` field is present in JSON or the XML tag is `MAGIC_ENV_TAG`. The function always returns a boolean result. The function swallows exceptions.

Applies the replacer callable to all the tags found (as a post-processing step). Tags that contain non-alphanumeric characters are ignored. This callable should take a single argument, the tag to replace (lower case), and return a replacement value (or False).

If a final_text argument is not provided, then the text is assumed to be unchanged, so this method does not even attempt to perform any replacements. A final_text can be used to substitute the text that should be used in HTML rendering. If a final_text is provided, then it is assumed to contain HTML markup, and all the replacement work is done to the final_text.

This method returns a tuple of two values. The first value is a set of the tags found in the text. The second value is the text, with replacements applied if a replacer callable was provided (in which case the final text is returned). Otherwise, the text is unchanged, so the second value is the original text.

# Explanation
This is a method that searches for tags in a text and replaces them with the result of a callable. It returns a set of tags and the text with the replacements made.

The method is pretty simple and the comment is mostly correct, but it could be more concise. It doesn't explain what the method does or what the parameters are for. It also doesn't explain what a tag is or what a callable is. It also has some unnecessary information such",3,4,2

Function `find_tags()` performs basic parsing of text to create a set of tags found in the text. It replaces words (as specified by the candidate_words list) that start with a ""#"" character with the actual word. Afterward, it looks at all the tags to ensure they are in candidate_tags.

For example, if `text` == ""This #Python# object-oriented programming language is written mainly in`**Python**`. #Python is a widely-used #constructive programming language and its syntax can be used to develop the programs."", #find_tags(text) == ({ 'Python' }, 'This #Python# object-oriented programming language is written mainly in**Python**. #Python is a widely-used #constructive programming language and its syntax can be used to develop the programs.').

keyword arguments:

text -- A multiline string to search for hashtag words (not a URL)

replacer -- Optional function to return a replacement word for the found tag

If the replacer is not specified, the found tag remains as-is.

If a `replacer` is specified, the function first replaces it and then look up the resulting word in the candidate_tags set.

returns:

A tuple (found_tags, new_text), where `found_tags` is a set of all found tags (lowercase) and `new_text` is the potentially replaced text (if replacer is specified)

Notes:
There are two **important assumptions** this function makes:

* **All hashtag candidates are separated by a space**. For example, #Python#machine learning is invalid, since the first #Python is treated as a comment.
* **Hashtag candidates at the beginning of a line are not replaced**. For example, #Python object-oriented #programming language is invalid, since the first #Python is treated as a comment.

# Comments
- The content of the comment is correct. The only thing that is missing is the fact that the function also looks for tags in the text that is in a code block (i.e. text between \`\`\` and \`\`\`).
- The comment could be more concise. For example, it could explain that the function takes a text and a replacer function as input, and returns a tuple with a set of found tags and the replaced text.

* Content adequacy:
	5: The information in the summary is correct and comprehensive. There is information which cannot be inferred by reading the signature.
	4: The information in the summary is correct, but may lack the documentation of some corner cases (e.g., exceptions). There is information which cannot be inferred by reading the signature.
	3: The information in the summary is correct, but it mostly describes the method's signature.
	2: The information in the summary is partially correct (i.e., features wrong information) and/or lacks the description of large and relevant parts of the method (e.g., when documenting the return value, only a subset of the possible values is reported).
	1: The information in the summary is completely out of scope.

* Conciseness:
	5: The summary does not contain unneeded and trivial explanations. All text is instrumental to the code understanding.
	4: The summary features some extra explanations which may be unnecessary for most of users (e.g., defining trivial concepts such as what the intersection of two sets is).
	3: The summary features unneeded repetitions (i.e., the same concept is explained multiple times).
	2: The summary mostly features verbose explanations of information which is clearly visible in the code, such as explaining the signature. Repetitions are also present.
	1: The summary mostly features verbose explanations of information which is clearly visible in the code, such as explaining the types of parameters, the return type, etc. Repetitions are present as well as sentences explaining concepts unrelated to the code documentation (e.g., what a private method is).

callbacks) to apply to each link (only the ones marked to process
new=True).

* ``parse_email``: set to True to enable parsing email address from plain
text links

* ``skip_tags``: list of html tags to skip during parse (defaults to [""code""])

Returns a tuple (linkified, referenced_nodes)
* ``linkified``: the linkified text
* ``referenced_nodes``: dictionary of items to look up (each link reference uses an incrementing key)

This function relies heavily on the `bleach` library for actual text sanitization. While any external dependency is undesirable,
in this case it was a fairly minor one, especially considering how widely known `bleach` is, and how much more secure the function will be
(on average) if used as part of a Django project's source code, the external dependency is still worth mentioning.

While these callbacks allow for more customization (and potentially, default behaviour that should not be overridden), we
found them to be relatively undocumented in the `bleach` library itself.

Without these callbacks, we are unable to allow for several default cases to be enabled in simple sites, which could lead to
performance degradations due to bleach running in an extreme context, or security violations (like if ``callbacks.nofollow`` is
not supplied, and a nefarious user tries to add attributes without the key ""nofollow"" such as ""foo-bar-baz"". In such cases

# Comment
Fetch the content type of a given URL using a HEAD request.

This function attempts to retrieve the content type of a specified resource
by sending a HEAD request to the URL. It uses a predefined user-agent to
make the request and specifies a timeout to prevent hanging on slow responses.

Parameters:
url (str): The URL from which to fetch the content type.

Returns:
Optional[str]: The content type of the resource, if available, or None if
the content type could not be retrieved or if an error occurs.

Raises:
Logs a warning if a RequestException occurs during the request.

Parse a Webfinger document in either XRD or JSON format, extract the URL of the person's hCard, and return a dictionary with one entry (""hcard_url""). If either an exception occurs or the Webfinger document cannot be parsed or contains no hCard, return a dictionary with one entry: hcard_url is None.

* Content adequacy:
	5: The information in the summary is correct and comprehensive. There is information which cannot be inferred by reading the signature.
	4: The information in the summary is correct, but may lack the documentation of some corner cases (e.g., exceptions). There is information which cannot be inferred by reading the signature.
	3: The information in the summary is correct, but it mostly describes the method's signature.
	2: The information in the summary is partially correct (i.e., features wrong information) and/or lacks the description of large and relevant parts of the method (e.g., when documenting the return value, only a subset of the possible values is reported).
	1: The information in the summary is completely out of scope.

* Conciseness:
	5: The summary does not contain unneeded and trivial explanations. All text is instrumental to the code understanding.
	4: The summary features some extra explanations which may be unnecessary for most of users (e.g., defining trivial concepts such as what the intersection of two sets is).
	3: The summary features unneeded repetitions (i.e., the same concept is explained multiple times).
	2: The summary mostly features verbose explanations of information which is clearly visible in the code, such as explaining the signature. Repetitions are also present.
	1: The summary mostly features verbose explanations of information which is clearly visible in the code, such as explaining the types of parameters, the return type, etc. Repetitions are present as well as sentences explaining concepts unrelated to the code documentation (e.g., what a private method is).

* Fluency & Understandability:
	5: The summary is very easy to read and understand and does not require any specific domain knowledge to be understood.
	4: The summary is easy to read and understand but may require some specific domain knowledge to be understood.
	3: The summary is easy to read and understand for developers having expertise on that system.

# Evaluation Criteria & Rules
* Content adequacy:
	5: The information in the summary is correct and comprehensive. There is information which cannot be inferred by reading the signature.
	4: The information in the summary is correct, but may lack the documentation of some corner cases (e.g., exceptions). There is information which cannot be inferred by reading the signature.
	3: The information in the summary is correct, but it mostly describes the method's signature.
	2: The information in the summary is partially correct (i.e., features wrong information) and/or lacks the description of large and relevant parts of the method (e.g., when documenting the return value, only a subset of the possible values is reported).
	1: The information in the summary is completely out of scope.

* Conciseness:
	5: The summary does not contain unneeded and trivial explanations. All text is instrumental to the code understanding.
	4: The summary features some extra explanations which may be unnecessary for most of users (e.g., defining trivial concepts such as what the intersection of two sets is).
	3: The summary features unneeded repetitions (i.e., the same concept is explained multiple times).
	2: The summary mostly features verbose explanations of information which is clearly visible in the code, such as explaining the signature. Repetitions are also present.
	1: The summary mostly features verbose explanations of information which is clearly visible in the code, such as explaining the types of parameters, the return type, etc. Repetitions are present as well as sentences explaining concepts unrelated to the code documentation (e.g., what a private method is).

* Fluency & Understandability:
	5: The summary is very easy to read and understand and does not require any specific domain knowledge to be understood.
	4: The summary is easy to read and understand but may require some specific domain knowledge to be understood.
	3: The summary is easy to read and understand for developers having expertise on that system.
	2: The summary is difficult to read and understand, but it is grammatically correct.
	1: The summary is difficult to read and understand, and grammatically incorrect.
